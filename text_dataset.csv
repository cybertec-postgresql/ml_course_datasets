"18270_0.txt",1,"I really liked this film for what it is. I also think that it is undoubtedly the most eye-opening film I ever saw in terms of the reality of the daily life of some people. Violet grew up in this house full of prostitutes, without a childhood, never knowing how to behave as a child. She grew up knowing how to behave in order to promote business in their 'house'. The deflowering ritual that Violet had to undergo would have scared me senseless, and it is pitifully sad to think that she looked forward to it, only because then the other women in the house would really take her seriously. The fact of the matter is, this is a true story and people should watch it, even if only to realise how grateful we should be for not living in times like that, for growing up in times where we are actually given a choice."
"42745_0.txt",2,"Myself and my partner decided to give this movie a try we went by the trailer. I wish that we had spent our time doing something more constructive.. Party at my house for a 24 hour paint watching marathon. Getting back on track.. Velvet luv. oh boy. I think I have seen better acting at a school play. 2nd grade I should say.. ""you make me hot baby"" When we started seeing the scenes with velvet in them my thoughts were you gotta be kidding me, is this a low grade horror movie or some cheesy porn flick. we decided to follow through with the movie to see what exactly happens, unfortunately the plot was too obvious and we ended up guessing what was going to happen. Some reason I felt psychic, now if only I could have predicted the lottery numbers then I would have been set, unfortunately this movie is too predictable. If your thinking of watching this, I would seriously think twice, due to the poor acting, little tips though... when you place a false hand made of silicon or rubber.. make sure that you don't shine a light onto that prop, and for the woman in stockings when you act dead, try not to clasp your hand around the other actors hand and most important of all... ( Don't Blink ) I am not going to spoil it for you guys as thats the type of person I am, so if your going to watch it.. good luck, oh by the way.. This movie should actually carry a government health warning! ( This film can cause serious manic depression for the hour and half of your life )"
"2719_0.txt",3,"OK i read this book and was curious to see the movie to see what they would.<br /><br />I had seen many Russian series before this and was generally unimpressed as i think they spent all the money on the cars and not anything else.<br /><br />Furthermore Goblin and a few other reviewers and critics i read were generally so so on it.<br /><br />So i was incredibly surprised to find how well they pulled this off. Its not an issue of ""accuracy"" (even though an acquaintances mother who is a teacher of literature in Russia and read this 20 times cover to cover was very satisfied) it is an issue of originality. The black and white to color switches, the acting, the actors, the music i found it really well done as well it should be since it is so well loved in Russia.<br /><br />Really they put in the effort and i was generally pleased with the result. Again not due to ""accuracy"" or inaccuracy, as that is impossible to do with certain films but with the originality and what i thought was quality film making.<br /><br />Btw, when Kot Begemot turned into the guy who plays Stira in ShtrafBat, my jaw dropped seeing as that was the person with the ""cat eyes"" who i pictured when i read Master and Bulgakov described him.<br /><br />10 stars is an understatement."
"20406_0.txt",4,"Back in the 1970s, some young directors really believed it was possible to make movies for television, rather than ""TV movies"" (one-episode 90 minute TV shows or the longer, even less cinematic soap opera 'miniseries'). The best known of these efforts was Spielberg's ""Duel,"" but there were good films appearing now and again all the way up 'till about 1983, which saw the ""Day After"" phenomenon, following which Republicans put such pressure on TV producers, they never attempted anything risky on broadcast TV again.<br /><br />This movie may very well be Peter Hyam's best. It certainly boasts the best later performance by Richard Boone as a washed-out detective and a knock-down performance by Michael Dunne as his side-kick. The camera-work, the pacing, the dialog, are all low-key, but need to be - this is an homage to the noir films of the forties, not a ""Chinatown"" attempt to resurrect them. Consequently there's a great deal of gentle humor here, but it never gets campy, and doesn't get in the way of a tight little mystery that is doomed to end badly for everyone - the detectives succeed in the end only because they live to be able to tell the tale (and are smart enough to know not to waste their breath telling it). There's a general feeling of 'life happens"" pervading the film - as was also the case for the noir films toward the end of that genre as it faded after WWII. Despite the low-key approach, the film is highly memorable for its atmosphere and characterizations. I haven't seen it for years and I still think of seeing it with pleasure. Probably a lost film (although I suppose you can find anything on the internet), this could be well worth the research to rediscover."
"39721_0.txt",5,"As Keystone comedies go, this is a pretty dark and depressing little piece of work. There's an amusing moment or two along the way, thanks largely to Roscoe Arbuckle's physical dexterity, but the story is more harrowing than funny, with an ending that's like something out of Kafka. And if you know the details of Arbuckle's tragic life and career the distressing impact of FATTY JOINS THE FORCE is only compounded.<br /><br />The story gets under way in a park. Fatty and his wife encounter cop Edgar Kennedy, who apparently tosses off a sassy remark (about Roscoe's girth?) en route to a flirtation with a nursemaid. While the cop and the maid are chatting, the nurse's charge, a little girl, wanders off and then falls into the lake. Fatty comes to the rescue and saves the little girl, who turns out to be the Police Commissioner's daughter. Fatty the hero is 'rewarded' with a position on the police force, but quickly gets into trouble. He falls afoul of a group of teenage boys who easily get the better of him. By the end, due to a misunderstanding, the one-time hero is mistaken for a dangerous ""wild man,"" and winds up in jail himself, disgraced and sobbing with frustration while his wife flirts with the Police Commissioner.<br /><br />How funny does that sound? . . . Not so funny, right? And when you consider that Arbuckle himself plummeted from a position of wealth and celebrity to genuine and lasting disgrace, due, according to the most credible research, to a tragic misunderstanding, the weepy close-up of Roscoe in his jail cell that concludes this film is even more disturbing than it might otherwise be. History buffs will be reminded of the infamous composite photo that ran in the Hearst papers at the height of the Arbuckle scandal in 1921, showing a grim-faced Roscoe supposedly behind bars in San Francisco, facing rape and manslaughter charges. (The charges were real, all right, but the photo was faked.) Even taken on its own terms, FATTY JOINS THE FORCE is short on laughs. Roscoe executes a couple of funny falls, and reacts strenuously to a pie in the face, but otherwise this movie is about as comical as Hitchcock's THE WRONG MAN."
"41136_0.txt",6,"Ever since I was 12, I fell in love with SpongeBob, and could imitate his voice very well and liked the show for years. But now it has changed significantly in the middle of 4th and 5th season and has gotten worse. SpongeBob has changed in a bad way, and also the humor has changed. What's with SpongeBob's new smile? It freaks me out, his original smile was just fine. The plots of the newest episodes seem pointless; SpongeBob and other characters seem to becoming more stupid. The studio has got to get their heads together and redeem the show or it will lose its high ratings and come to an end. However, I will still like SpongeBob in the early years."
"49474_0.txt",7,"I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because I have a step father who I often feud with. So naturally I was hopping this would cheer me up and get me to laugh. But boy did this movie depress me and boy did it make me angry.<br /><br />First let me go over what I did like about this film before I trash it. It had what could have been a really good and funny plot. Our lead character discovers that the evil gym teacher that tormented him in middle school is now going to marry his mother. Basically think of that teacher from high school or middle school who hated your guts. You didn't do anything he/she just hated you and made it clear. Now imagine if that teacher going to be your new stepfather/stepmother. What do you do? This sounded hysterical and in the films defenses there were a few funny moments. Sadly however those funny moments were all given away in the trailer. This would be the first problem I had with this film. All the parts that come to mind as being the highlights were already spoiled and what's left is okay but not great.<br /><br />However let's talk about the story a little more. As I said before our star use to be stuck with an evil gym teacher who was out to make his life a living hell. Now he's all grown up and has used his experiences with ""Mr. Woodcock"" to write a self help book. This book becomes a best seller and he now teaches people how to let go of there past. Things are going well until his past come back to hunt him! Now that also could of bin funny. Watching a mans message of letting go of the past get challenge by the bad things that happen to him long ago. Sadly it does not play out well and I will explain later.<br /><br />This Woodcock fellow dose not seem to regret any of the mean things he has done to him. In fact he's very mean to everyone and everything. They made him such a jerk to the point you can't bring your self to like his character. The mom on the other hand seem really nice but one cant help but wonder what is she thinking, is she that desperate? The guy makes very rude and mean spirited comments to her son, even going far to make sex comments about his mother. He treats the people in the town like dirt and everything that comes out of his moth is negativity and insults. Some time his abuse gets physical.<br /><br />So I was starting to think the story was about an evil step father who the son had to save his mother from marrying. After all for some reason he and us the viewer can only see what a bad guy Woodcock really is. But no. By the end of the movie the son must learn to Respect Woodcock and his very abusive ways. So according to the movie women are better off pretending there abusive spouse is a good guy in spite of the fact he treats the world like dirt. For all women can't be happy unless they have a man, even if he is a creep. What kind of message is that to send out! Okay, dose our hero at least manage to persevere his message he has become popular selling? No, by the end he turns back on all of that and decided to take after his mom. Give into stock home syndrome and convinces himself that Woodcock is a good guy. So he finds himself apologizing to an unapologetic abusive jerk. He even declares that all the abuses was good for him. What kind of message are they trying to send out? Well did Woodcock learn any lessons, become sorry for his actions and show off that there is a nice guy in there some ware? As I already said no. They make it very clear he is not sorry for any the things he dose. In the movies Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers, our lead faced a similar problem with his father in law to be. However that worked out on screen much better. Why? Because by the end the Character who was being a jerk learned his lesson and realizes he was in the wrong. Something that never happens here. The best we get is when Woodcock said ""I'm ""Basically"" sorry"" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused.<br /><br />To make things a little worse thing are never resolved. Like there a little romance going on between our star and a girl he knew from his old school but it never went any ware. In fact in one moment our ""hero"" cames off as a bit of jerk to because it seems he did not care much for her at all. So now our lead character not that likable earthier. Then when it gets to the end the movie feels as if it just stops. No laterally, it feels like it stop in mid-moment and then the credits start. Leaving the movie feeling unfinished and made to quickly.<br /><br />Over all what could of bin a good movie falls apart because things are never resolved, characters are unlikable, and sends out the message that abuse; verbal or physical is cool as long as your mom love him.<br /><br />That Why Mr. Woodcock gets a 3 out of 10."
"36746_0.txt",8,"Mel Gibson plays a military test pilot who agrees to become the subject of a cryogenic experiment after the love of his life ends up in an 'irreversable' coma in 1939. Well, the experiment is completely forgotten about and he remains in the deep freeze until he is set free by some kids trespassing in an army warehouse. Mel awakens to find a different world, and, needless to say, love. What do you get when you mix a big star like Gibson with a sappy script and a mediocre director like Steve Minor: A sappy and contrived film. Boy, is it sappy. Boy, is it contrived. This is practically a convention of unwarranted coincidences, unresolved situations and unanswered implications. The film stirs to life on occasion, but it never manages to amount to much."
"12622_0.txt",9,"In this one, Matt Helm's antagonist is Count Contini, a gold smuggler, played by Nigel Green. He is aided by his gang of thugs and two female sidekicks, Linka (Elke Sommer) and Gwen Ya-Rang (Nancy Kwan). As might be expected, both try to seduce Matt, offering fake carrots. Interestingly for a Matt Helm movie, however, Linka is a rare woman in Matt's orbit who is the recipient, rather than initiator, of the first display of interest. Earlier, there is a nice scene in which Lola Medini (Tina Louise), a former associate of Contina, seduces Matt in connection with the intrigue.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is Freya Carlson (Sharon Tate) who gets her man. She is a Danish tourist agent who leads Matt around in fulfilling his duties. Like Stella Stevens in ""The Silencers,"" she is initially quite clumsy, and is involved in a nice wetlook scene (actually, so is Linka). Freya helps Matt foil the villains.<br /><br />I'm focusing mostly on the women here, but hey, you can hardly beat this bunch in this male fantasy series. The only Bond movie that can rival this group is ""Thunderball.""<br /><br />"
"13896_0.txt",10,"This was one of my first ""Disney Midquel"" experiences, the very first being the Fox and the Hound 2. I haven't a clue why Disney has taken up this hideous trend. Their midquels spoil practically everything about their original counterparts.<br /><br />I was (and I'm sure that others were too) hoping for a story about Bambi's twin fawns Geno and Gurri from the novel Bambi's Children. Instead I received this nightmare. I'll not spoil the story for those interested in this garbage, but I will say that every classic character was ruined by a chatty, modern attitude. The character that bothered me most was the redone Faline. She was not at all her adorable old self, but quiet, reserved, and having a slightly darker, more dullish-brown coat, thus erasing all of her original appeal. <br /><br />Despite the lovely animation, I could not enjoy how Disney made such a lackluster and unoriginal followup to one of their most successful films of all time."
"42743_0.txt",11,"Hands down the dullest show MTV has ever pimped up out of its pimpy sleeves. Take a shoddy car, stuff a few superfluous accessories in it - such as advanced DVDs whose features you won't use at home let alone in a damn car - and then watch the vehicle's owner (always a moron) throw a hysterical fit of jubilation once he sees how over-the-top silly his car has become. You are now the proud owner of a car that is good enough for any gay-pride parade! Throw in a dumb rapper with an appropriately idiotic name, and a bunch of criminal-looking (hence ""cool"") pseudo-mechanics, and you've got yourself the ultimate television sleeping pill. I sometimes think the only way for me to wake up during an episode of PMR is if the car in question actually left the screen and smashed right into me.<br /><br />The only thing Xzibit exhibits is his profound talent for memorizing several lines at a time, a feat for which they probably had to cast dozens of braindead, barely successful rappers. His pitiful jokes do MTV justice, i.e. are on par with the expectations of the gooey substances that make up the brains of most MTV viewers. Maybe they should pimp Xzibit's teeth next time: there simply isn't enough gold and silver glittering in that damn mouth of his.<br /><br />The cars that are picked for dem-da-pimpin' are supposedly all owned by poor students and the like. So how is it a favour to those people to give them a car that will need ultra-security to prevent it from being stolen within the first two days? My advice to future PMC customers: sell the car IMMEDIATELY to some desperate nerdy fan of the show, and then buy a REAL car.<br /><br />As for using the word ""pimp"" as a verb and all that, well what's to say that is new? MTV loves to contribute its lion's share in the dumbing-down of the 21st-century populace. If that means glorifying rent-a-whore ""businessmen"" or raping the English language, even better.<br /><br />German MTV has managed to go one ""better"", however. ""Pimp Mein Fahrrad"" is about doing dull things to bicycles. What's next? Pimp My Girlfriend? (Actually, that would be interesting!) Pimp My Toilet Paper?"
"21810_0.txt",12,"I was obsessed with this movie when it came out. Firstly, I was the age of the characters and into that scene, that music, etc. Secondly, being from Melbourne, it was all very real. Also, Sam Sejavka, who the film is based on, came to my school in the mid-eighties and used some of my friends in a video-clip for his band, Beargarden. My sister's best friend, Deanna, played 'the girl' in the movie.<br /><br />So we went and saw the movie underaged and followed it with that cult-like devotion, for a while it seemed every afflicted night would end with us trying to or finding the house, etc etc. There was so much to the movie we could identify with. Much later I went and saw 3 or 4 plays that Sejavka had written or directed. On the whole they were brilliant, particularly 'In Angel Gear', and most had the same feel of Dogs In Space. Saskia Post was in one of them.<br /><br />This is probably no use to those who haven't seen it. But in concurrence with most who have written - it was so, so real."
"25737_0.txt",13,"I saw this film at the Milwaukee International Film Festival Oct. 2005. The director/writer warned us it was dark and that we could laugh. And that it was. The time just flew by while we watched the movie, which makes me feel like I didn't waste my time. Max has a lot of issues in this movie. He's a jerk. But somehow, at the end, you're OK with him being that way. I don't want to give away anything. There is nudity and there is a ton of swearing and touchy subject matters, this is not a movie for anyone who dislikes those things. I liked all the casting and the writing/plot was interesting. Didn't see the twist coming. I don't know if Milwaukee received a bad copy (is that even possible anymore?), but the film quality had a bit to be desired. Some bad sound areas and some weird stuff on the film itself, maybe that can be repaired once the film is picked up. I wish them luck!! Patrick Warbarton was in the theater for the viewing. He was very nice."

Tony Gatlif.<br /><br />Well with this been said, I don't think I have very much more to add. It's everything what the director said. I never really liked musical movies, I am like most people. And I must admit that as well as me others missed out on great movies.<br /><br />I have worked for a long time in a video store and I saw that many musical movies were put aside. It doesn't mean that musicals are by definition good, but it's like our system block them automatically away and we won't watch them. Why? I don't know. Because of our childhood? Does our body protest thanks to movies like Sound of music and Mary Poppins and etc.<br /><br />Could be. Even Dancer in the dark didn't do well in the video store. From an instant when people heard that some people sing in it they left it behind and didn't wanted too see it although it was directed by Lars Von Trier.<br /><br />But those who did see it thought it was great! Well, it is the same with this movie, those who saw it thought it was great, those who heard people sang in it, didn't even bother to turn their back and try out on something they always rejected and therefore missed something. I really liked Vengo and I enjoyed the music allot. And I didn't regret it for a second."
"24536_0.txt",15,"I was introduced to the ""X-Men"" as a kid in the 1990s when I started seeing episodes of the cartoon show. Later, I started playing an X-Men video game, and during my comic book phase, I do recall reading some X-Men ones. Since then, the comic book series has been one of several to get the live action movie treatment at some point within the past ten years or so. I didn't see too many films on the big screen back in 2000, so I didn't see this this first ""X-Men"" movie adaptation. I finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel, ""X2"", but I have now seen it more than once, and it is good.<br /><br />In the near future, many mutated humans exist. They are born with a special X-Factor gene, which gives each of them a certain superpower. Unfortunately, these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity, even though many of them mean no harm. In the X-Mansion, where many good mutants live, Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for students with the special X-Factor gene, where they learn how to use their gifts wisely. Xavier dreams of a society where mutants can live with the rest of humanity in peace. However, another mutant named Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto), who was once Xavier's friend, has different plans. He has a machine that can convert non-mutated humans, and he plans to speed up the process of human evolution with it! For some reason, one unbeknownst to anyone in the X-Mansion, Magneto and his evil mutants are after either Logan or Rogue, two recent arrivals at the mansion! <br /><br />Comic book movies from recent years are generally not known to be flawless, so it's no surprise that ""X-Men"" has some fairly weak moments. After the first scene, which is set in 1944, and the story skips to the near future, where the rest of the movie takes place, the film gets pretty shaky, starting with Rogue in her room with her boyfriend, just before she discovers her powers. I would say the story really gets good around the part when Logan (a.k.a. Wolverine) first finds himself in the X-Mansion. After that, it doesn't stay completely steady for the rest of the film, but usually is pretty entertaining, with a decent amount of action and suspense, as well as good special effects, some intriguing futuristic sets, and occasional humour. I can't say TOO many of the cast performances here really stand out, but those of Patrick Stewart (as Xavier), Ian McKellen (as Magneto), and Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine) do. The script isn't perfect, but for the most part, it's better than the ""Hulk"" and ""Catwoman"" scripts (two very disappointing comic book movies), that's for sure. Here, there's a mixture of strong and weak dialogue and acting.<br /><br />So, overall, this first ""X-Men"" movie does have its cheesy moments, but that certainly doesn't mean it has no entertainment value. Now, some people strongly dislike these recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, and if you're one of them, I'm sure saying that this one has its cheesy moments is a gross understatement to you, if you've seen it. However, if you don't like this kind of movie, it's simple, don't watch it. For those whose interest is often captured by comic book movies like this, there may be some films of this kind which are best to avoid, most notably the more poorly received ones, but ""X-Men"" certainly isn't one of those, even if it's not the best adaptation of a comic book series ever made."
"6434_0.txt",16,"IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH you feel the anguish, the anger and the pain of what this dreadful war in Iraq has done to American families and our soldiers. ELAH is a powerful film from the brilliant Director Paul Haggis that drives home on the screen in a magnificent performance from Tommy Lee Jones the fear a father may have in the loss of his son and how this war is being played out in the small towns of America where a family wonders if a man, or woman, might return home safe, or in a body bag. Charlize Theron and Susan Sarandon with a solid cast bring home the horror of Iraq in a film that is today's war in the Middle East. I can only hope that at Kudo time this well directed and written film will find itself on the list of nominated films. Bravo Paul Haggis for giving us another film to root for as we did with CRASH."
"26797_0.txt",17,"Having fought heroically in World War I, Gen. Billy Mitchell (Gary Cooper) tried to get his superiors to establish an Air Force. When they refused, he disobeyed orders and was sent to Fort Sam Houston, demoted to the rank of colonel. After there are two fatal crashes in which the planes were not properly equipped, Mitchell denounces his superiors and is put on trial for insubordination. While the prosecution tries to prove that he made the statements, Mitchell does everything possible to show that the statements were justified.<br /><br />The movie seems to have even more relevance today, with the story about the Humvees in Iraq that lacked sufficient armor. The army brass could really use some advice from Billy Mitchell.<br /><br />As a side note, it was interesting seeing Elizabeth Montgomery (as the widow of Mitchell's friend who gets killed in one of the crashes) before she starred on ""Bewitched""."
"48988_0.txt",18,"The Laughing Dead is an incredibly cheesy low budget film without any value. It handles about a bus-load of social misfits (guided by a priest who lost his faith and impregnated a foxy nun) on a sightseeing tour around Aztec ruins in Mexico. There, they're awaited by a bunch of demons, zombies and mad-raving creatures in order to kill them during the 'Death Festival'. The first 45 minutes of 'The Laughing Dead' is very tedious viewing since they're presenting us a character drawing nobody really cares about. The priest and the nun are re-united and he learns he's the father of a bratty kid. There's no intrigue and the acting is very lame so the first half is very tough to sit through. After that, The Laughing Dead turns into a joyful splatter movie with cheesy make-up effects and a repulsive amount of blood. People's heads are chopped off (and used as a basketball), buses drive over torsos and one poor bastards even has his own arm shoved down his throat!! The film is bad and extremely amateurish, but there's a market for this kind of crap. So, if you're in to gory nonsense you can check this one out."
"26226_0.txt",19,"Swimming Pool contained good symbolism, acting, and especially great cinematography. The movie was really too slow for me for the first 70 mintues, however, and I kept wondering, what is the point of painting us a pictures of this dour and unhappy author's interactions with a lustful irresponsible bratty young woman? Although I admired the character portrayal and felt the movie visually artistic and even brilliant at times, I was not emotionally invested in Sarah Morton enough nor in Julie's to care. However, the ending changed all of that.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS BELOW!***<br /><br />The twist at the end reminded me of Fight Club and and Sixth Sense, where all of a sudden the viewer realizes he percieved everything through the wrong lens. When the twist reveals that the Julie we've seen never existed, all of a sudden everything in the story takes a deeper meaning and we can appreciate all the time it took to create a detailed character study of Sarah Morton.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how literate this movie was, the symbolism very well constructed. It's funny how people either critisize or praise all the nudity and sexuality common in European film, however here nudity and sexuality were intrinsically necessary because they were such a crucial component underlying the mechanics of Sarah Morton's personality. She was so repressed! I really liked how Julie's appetite for sex, rich food, and swimming in the ""dirty"" pool was a mirror for just how badly Sarah lacked all of these things. I especially loved the scenes where Sarah eats yogurt and wheat germ. Here we have a woman, who although she is super wealthy and can afford any type of food, instead chooses to deprieve herself of such a basic source of pleasure as eating appetizing food.<br /><br />It is a nice contradiction that Sarah is very wealthy on the outside yet starving (for good food, sexuality, a zest for living, creativity) on the inside. This movie further gives evidence to the fact that fame and wealth are not a guarantee of genuine happiness in life.<br /><br />The ending to this film made it all worthwhile, however and it is very exciting when we feel we need a 2nd viewing of a movie to really absorb it all. I will watch it again and who knows? I might not find the first 70 minutes too slow after all.<br /><br />"
"35088_0.txt",20,"A Roger Corman quickly produced cheapie that wears its influences proudly, as many elements (character descriptions to lifted sequence ideas) just reek of Ridley Scott's 1979 feature ''Alien''. However this systematic fodder remains enjoyable (for most part, despite its often lumpy pacing) on a very b-grade level, as it doesn't pretend to be anything else than cheap, exploitative fun. Instead of being set in space like that classic, the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting due to a chemically induced plague wiping out the majority of the earth's population. Nevertheless a small bunch of scientists are holding up in an underground laboratory in the bone-dry desert, but their existence is soon threatened by genetic mutations known as gargoyles. These beasties are quite randy too, because at nearly every opportunity they go out of their way to impregnate the women. What the story lacks in imagination (as it does draw upon a predictable amalgam) and coherence, it makes up for in durable performances (a likable Andrew Stevens, George Kennedy, John Lafayette, Starr Andreeff and Terri Treas all keeping it straight) and gruesomely tacky splatter (even though it doesn't have much impact in engineering the deaths and tawdry jolts). Being rough and crude, it's kind of similar in style / budget to the likes of ''Creepazoids'' and ""Parasite"". The creatures are kept off screen during the first half, to only be heard and getting some POV shots. Nonetheless we do get to see them, and it's a fair looking monster design of a man in a rubber suit. Everything looks low-rent, which is cemented by its compact setting and stuffily framed direction but still lingering within is a grim atmosphere. The music score tagged to the project isn't too bad either, being high-strung but ominously pitched. Mechanically uninspired, but gruellingly cheesy entertainment."
"5632_0.txt",21,"Highly fictional movie about the love affair between Clark Gable (James Brolin) and Carole Lombard (Jill Clayburgh). It chronicles how they first meet and hate each other but eventually fall in love. The problem is Gable's first wife won't give him a divorce and their studios are threatening to drop them.<br /><br />There are so many factual errors here it's pointless to try and discuss them all. The biggest one for me was the portrayal of Louis B. Mayer (badly played by Allen Garfield) as a kindly man. He was loud and obnoxious and treated the actors like dirt. Here he comes across as a nice gentle father figure which is wildly inaccurate. Still if you just accept this as a fictional tale it's not too bad. It's pretty obvious they spent a lot of money on this--there's some truly beautiful sets and clothes. Also the script isn't too bad. It mostly consists of Brolin and Clayburgh screaming and arguing with each other or hopping into bed...but it still works.<br /><br />Brolin is VERY convincing as Gable. He looks like him and sounds like him. Also, from what I've heard, he pretty much gave an accurate portrayal of Gable as he really was. Clayburgh looks nothing like Lombard but her acting is excellent and she does show Lombard as she actually was--strong, funny and independent. Also Red Buttons is excellent as a studio publicist. Beautiful music score too.<br /><br />There are a few problems. The movie is way too long--it's 131 minutes and should have been shorter. Also there's a truly tacky sequence involving a ""c**k soc"" that should have been eliminated. But, as a fictional tale, this is pretty good. R rated for swearing and very frank sexual talk."
"48519_0.txt",22,"I have seen A LOT of bad movies. I watch them on a regular basis and even some of the really bad ones, I can get through-ones that Mystery Sceince Theater 3000 wouldn't even touch. This is bar none the worst ""movie"" ever made. I use the term movie loosely in this case because it is more like a group of friends that got together and made a video, but sure enough it has some Troma in it. Even if you like the mindless Troma stuff, this one will make you wince in pain. It IS that bad!! The cover has Lilith Stabs on it (a hot goth/punk type girl of Bad Movie Police fame) in a little outfit with a huge gun. Very misleading. She is NOT in the movie and there are no gun toting babes gunning down zombies. Instead you get to watch an ugly chick with a chocolate stained face annoy the hell out of you with over eccentric bad acting and lisp. The imitation Cosby/Don King character-Bonejack-is something you would laugh at if it were your friend, otherwise it is just lame. The filmmakers felt free to make plenty of inside jokes (the reappearing ice cream poster in tons of shots) without letting the audience in on their little jokes. If this can truly be called a movie versus just a video that some idiots threw together, then yes. This is THE worst movie I have ever seen. It even beats out the Tempe classics such as Humanoids from Atlantis and Robot Ninja. At least with James L Edwards you know what you are getting into. I wonder how many suckers fell for the false advertising on the box cover. Well live and learn the old ""You can't judge a book by its cover"". Well Mulva didn't kick any zombie ass-but this movie sure kicked mine."
"40852_0.txt",23,"This was the worst damn movie I've ever seen! So I gave it a 2. It was funny, not because of the dialouge, but the dinosaur. It's so awful all the way through. The film at the begining looks it could be used in a travel video. They use 1985 stock footage of helicopters and raids that have the date and time in the top corner too. The dinosaur on the otherhand is the best part. When he takes to the pot from the helicopter all you see is a big green crudley made glove come up and grab at some green stuff in a toy net. IT'S AWESOME! If you're a fan of these horribly bad movies then this a treat, but good luck finding it. I'd feel sorry for you if actually did come across it. so so so so sorry oh yea, ""trog""<br /><br />"
"39893_0.txt",24,"As incredible as it seems, the only one of the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" trilogy I'd seen before the other night was the second one which I've seen more times than I'd care to admit. The original has completely passed me by but if it's as bad as this one then I think I'll give it a miss. If ever a film typified the Eighties and the flash-bang appeal of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer then, for me anyway, ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"" is it but this tired addition to the series has none of the charm or style of the early films. Only Eddie Murphy and Judge ""Will Work For Food"" Reinhold were daft enough to sell their souls for the sake of this disappointing drudgery.<br /><br />Murphy returns as Detroit maverick Axel Foley, who is on the trail on the man who gunned his boss down. After a raid on a chop shop ends in the death of Inspector Todd (Gil Hill), a distraught Foley chases the perps to Beverly Hills following his only lead to the distinctly Disney-ish Wonder World theme park. Teaming up once again with his old buddy Rosewood (Reinhold) and his new partner (Hector Elizondo), they track down a group of security guards at the park led by the popular Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart). De Wald secretly leads a complex money printing scheme within the park and Foley, still seeking revenge for Tood's death, defies the wishes of the FBI and goes after him in his own, unique way.<br /><br />Depending on how much you like Eddie Murphy's wide-mouthed shouting and screaming, there isn't a great deal to like about ""Beverly Hills Cop 3"". Murphy feels out-of-sorts while Reinhold still has the wide-eyed look of someone who is surprised that they're acting in a film at all. The comedy, when it comes, is forced and weak - the bizarre reappearance of the hideously annoying Serge (Bronson Pinchot) signals the sheer desperation of the writers. The plot is so weak that it's difficult to imagine how they sustained it for as long as they did. Remember how Foley tackled heavily armed and highly professional bank robbers in the second film? Here, he faces disgruntled security guards at a theme park. The life and joy of the earlier films is replaced with a lethargic laziness in all areas - acting, story, action, even the predictable romance with the park attendant (Theresa Randle) feels tacked on at the last minute. Throw in some pointless cameos - the most noticeable and enjoyable by George Lucas - and the whole thing feels as fake and tasteless as plastic fruit.<br /><br />Murphy has displayed an erratic choice of movies throughout his career but this is one of the worst. All it does is make you wish you were watching the earlier films or maybe something like ""Bad Boys"". Whereas ""Bad Boys"" is the true successor to the earlier ""Beverly Hills Cop"" films due to its heavily stylish look and comedic approach to the cop genre, this is tired and rehashed filler. Even the classic synthesiser theme music has been mangled, which shouldn't be surprising but it is disappointing. It feels as if it wants to be a restart for the series but it proves to be the death-knell. It badly misses the attention of producers Simpson & Bruckheimer and even Murphy looks like he's not that bothered. Basically, don't even think about watching this unless you wish to watch the whole series in one sitting. But quite frankly, why would you?"
"1442_0.txt",25,"This is one of those excellent short subject films that doesn't seem like either TV episode or someone attempting to get investors to expand it to feature length.

"39667_0.txt",26,"THE EXPERT, starring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL!!!<br /><br />Dull, characters, dull situations, dull direction, dull actors, dull cinematography, dull music.<br /><br />I don't really understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical ""Speakman pummeling bad guys"" scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama, which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. In the end, this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply doesn't belong in this kind of (dull) movie. It's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score, which makes the entire movie look even more confused, goofier and dull.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this, even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan."
"22315_0.txt",27,"Some people do not 'get' this show and I'm not sure why. I always think that they haven't watched enough to get to know the characters or they can't quite relate to the abstract brilliance of it all. Well I'm not one of them for sure, as this show has provided me with more laughs than any other. From the disgusting habits of Lister to the delightful cheekiness of The Cat to the smug remarks from Rimmer the comic moments just go on and on. And yes, the Grant-Naylor partnership was possibly key in maintaining the subtlety of the gags. Yet, I do not necessarily agree that Series 7 and 8 were a pointless waste of time. For me, these two series were worth it just for Kryten alone. His eccentricity and corruption sort of 'blossomed' in a way and I felt Robert Llewlelyn took his character in the right direction. This is a point that will probably be hounded but you only need to see the psychiatrist scenes from the final series to see what I mean.<br /><br />Sadly, the other characters in the latter series seem to lose some of the magic they so brilliantly weaved in front of a live audience. However, the stories were still good enough to entice my viewing throughout all 8. My personal favourite series is series two. Even though this was when they were still (pretty much) confined to the Red Dwarf ship, the scripts and dialogues were absolutely fantastic. 'Thanks for the Memory' is so brilliantly constructed I think of it as the best half hour of comedy ever written. The way it begins with the drunken starbug flight back and ends with the discovery of what Lister has done with Rimmer's memory is pure genius. Then you have that brilliant moment where Danny John-Jules nails a one-liner so sublimely that you just have to cackle. Rimmer (played by the ace Chris Barrie) attempts a ridiculous explanation to how they've ended up with unusual predicaments after a late night party (for example broken legs) and tries to ease everyone's worries by suggesting it was alien communication. Then Cat (Danny John Jules) simply says ""I wouldn't want to be around when one of these suckers is making a speech"".<br /><br />Anyway, I could go on and on with the praise, so I'd just like to say to everyone involved in the show.............. thanks for the memories!!"
"20835_0.txt",28,"I saw this film at a special screening at a RPG convention in Dublin, Ireland called Gaelcon. I couldn't get into the first screening on the Saturday evening as numbers were restricted and the show was full. Fortunately for me they showed it again on the Sunday evening due to the demand.<br /><br />It is a Scottish independent full-length comedy film about a misfit group of gamers and their geek lust for crazy Goth chick that believes she is an elf. On the face of it seems just a simple farce with clichéd characters but it does then start exploring the characters more deeply in the later part of the film. We learn that everyone has more to them than the 'masks' of the characters they portray in the in-movie game. The Celtic nature of the film adds to its magic, the Glaswegian landscape is just beautiful and the cast is very talented. <br /><br />It stars Edward Tudor-Pole and Eileen McCallum and introduces new talent Ross Finbow, James Young and Danielle Stewart as the ill- fated, star-crossed lovers. It is a funny movie and most role-players will see someone that they recognise (maybe themselves?) in the characters portrayed.<br /><br />It was a very good film, the audience at Gaelcon loved it as far as I could tell, with lots of laughter and some knowing nods now and again. Though they maybe the target audience for this film non-gamers will find it enchanting as well."
"6247_0.txt",29,"As a parent forced to endure a fair amount of kids entertainment, it is always a relief to find something that is at least tolerable to an adult. When my son became infatuated with the Care Bears, I had sit through the painful Care Bears Movie (1985) a number of times, and then through some excruciating videos of episodes from the mid-80s TV show.<br /><br />But then we got the DVD of Journey to Joke-a-lot, and the opening song by Jane Siberry immediately caught my attention. Then the story turned out to be engaging, and not too cloying, with enjoyable songs. And there's even a parody of scenes from 2001: A Space Odyssey! So I can say it greatly exceeded my expectations and I can recommend it as something at least passably entertaining to adults as well as children."
"15259_0.txt",30,"I have just finished watching the Complete Series DVD collection of ""Freaks and Geeks,"" one of the best high school television series on televisions that, thanks to idiotic network executives who continue to make the decisions that make network television more and more unbearable to watch, have truly missed out on a gem. And, thanks to a healthy fan network, I was able to enjoy every bit of the series (as short as it was) on DVD.<br /><br />Freaks and Geeks was one of the most honest portrayals of high school life, pleasantly departing from the overrated attention given to other television series and films who consistently focus on the ""untouchable"" classes of the dreaded high school social caste system that we are all likely too familiar with. The assorted teen dramas, and the difficulty of just subsisting in the often passively rigid classes within the high school social scene. This television series presented things from two perspectives: a group of freshman friends marked as ""The Geeks"" and a group of older friends, underachievers known as ""The Freaks."" The Geeks often provided the comical element to the show, while the Freaks often explore more dramatic story lines such as problems with parents (a constant subplot), self-esteem, drugs, and more. Although the Geeks confronted their own share of problems, their youth and easygoing attitude often made the situation more light-hearted.<br /><br />Other commentators have often posited the question (on the ""Freaks and Geeks"" board along with other short-lived television series) why shows like these never last long on television. While ""Saved by the Bell"" might have been the only show to be quite successful with it (though only after significant retooling of the original series, ""Good Morning Mrs. Bliss would NBC even agree to pick up the show), my guess is that this show may have initially had a difficult time finding a loyal audience in the crucial early days of the show. There were issues of drug use and teenage sex which some might not have found ideal for the younger viewers of this show (people in their very early teens as this show tended to sometimes celebrate drug use...even though there was one episode that was clearly anti-drug). Five years ago was a different time, however. And shows like ""The O.C."" (on Fox) seems to get away with stories surrounding its ""young"" characters and attitudes towards casual sex. Sadly, however, the network, too, is to blame, as it shifted the show into unrecognizable time slots, airing a show that was ideal for young audiences at a time when they would least likely be watching television--Friday and Sunday evenings. I cannot say that this would be why other television series surrounding high school would also be canceled.<br /><br />It might also be that the show was never given a fair chance. Some might have quickly judged it as a rip-off of ""The Wonder Years"" (John Daly and the Geek Gang--especially Neil and Harris--did look like characters you might find on that show, not to mention the high school looking just like that in The Wonder Years).<br /><br />My other guess for the reason that shows like these are often short-lived is that they are too expensive to produce. ""Freaks and Geeks,"" like ""My So-Called Life"" filled a lengthy time slot of fifty minutes or so. Filmed partially on location and partially on a set (like ""Sqaure Pegs"" and ""My So-Called Life""), a show like this becomes very expensive to produce and, may unfortunately force some hasty decisions about how long a network would ride out slack ratings.<br /><br />I still think NBC passed up a good thing, and possibly other networks if it was pitched to them once being canceled. It was a great show that tried to produce a very dynamic set of characters and stories and did well.<br /><br />I would also like to say while I adored nearly every character on the show (except for Nick who's obsession with Lindsay transformed him into not only a bizarre, but a boring character), I thought Martin Starr was the best as the witty Bill Haverchuck (I love his Bionic Woman bit when he is getting his costume ready in the Halloween episode). Though I thought him to be needlessly bizarre in the beginning (particularly due to his gawky appearance), he turned out to be one of the best characters. He always tried his best to be a good friend to everyone and, he always had some of the funniest lines in th show (Joe Flaherty, as Sam's dad, also had a bunch of good one-liners). And, while he was not in the show but sporadically, I also loved 'Harris,' the Geek mentor who always seemed so confident about everything.<br /><br />Long live Freaks and Geeks! May the television show's creators reconsider trying this one again (even if you have to start over with a new cast, since everyone has aged six years--as of this writing)."

Recently, his mother got a boyfriend whom she lets move in with them, and from then on, the plot goes downhill and gets lost in a plethora of senseless foul language, shameless and gratuitous sex, and drugs.<br /><br />Review: Baby Boy starts off as interesting, but after a half-hour into the film, it feels like John Singleton just stands up and shouts ""The hell with it!"" Basically, the movie's message was about the main character to get off his lazy a** and take care of his responsibilites. None of these characters in this movie would be someone I'd like to know, and I don't who was worse in this movie -- the black males or the black females. On the plus side, Tyrese proves that he can act. Too bad he does it in the wrong film. In closing, I think it would have been better if Singleton did a sequel to Boyz N the Hood that takes places 10 years after the original with Cuba Gooding, Jr.(Note: Cuba's brother, Omar, is in this film), Nia Long, and Laurence Fishburne returning rather than making this movie.<br /><br />My final 2 cents: Boyz N the Hood it ain't, Baby Boy has got to the worst film ever made by John Singleton.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10"

If you have never seen the Devil Wears Prada, then you will most likely enjoy this film.

"13354_0.txt",35,"I guess I can't complain too much, because for all intents and purposes, I got this movie for free. It came with a 'freaks' boxed set through Something Weird video, along with, among other movies, the classic 80's cheesefest BASKET CASE. At the time, purchasing BASKET CASE in this boxed set actually cost less than it did alone, so hey, a good deal is a good deal. And since I bought it, I gave SHE FREAK a day in court and watched it. Unfortunately, it isn't nearly as interesting as BASKET CASE. It's really only slightly more interesting than watching paint dry.<br /><br />SHE FREAK is, near as I can tell, the 1960's remake of the classic freak film FREAKS, directed by Tod Browning. Unlike Browning's movie, however, SHE FREAK contains almost no freaks at all. The biggest problem with this movie is that a grand majority of it contains stock footage of carnivals being set up and taken down, shots of random people on rides, and other such mundane images of fair grounds and carnies.<br /><br />What little story there is revolves around Jade Cochran (the late Claire Brennan), an average-to-homely woman who begins the movie as a coffee shop waitress with high aspirations. After getting fired from her job for not being appreciative enough (if you know what I mean), she finds work at the local carnival, becoming good friends with one of the strippers. She eventually meets and seduces Steve St. John (Bill McKinney) and marries him, although it's made very plain that she's a bit on the easy side, as prior to the marriage she has a little bedroom bam-bam with Blackie Fleming (Lee Raymond), a man egotistical enough to decorate the walls of trailer with his own name in spray paint.<br /><br />Steve St. John, Jade's new husband, is in charge of the freak show, something that deeply disturbs Jade. See, Jade is a bit on the shallow side, thinking more about the material advantages of marrying a man with money and less about the human side of his work trying to make a life for people who might not otherwise have one. Since Steve isn't the most attentive of husbands, Jade's little fling with Blackie continues despite the marriage. Then, one night, the only freak in the movie--a little person named, appropriately, ""Shorty""--sees Jade getting it on with Blackie, and while he says nothing, he makes his dislike of Jade as clear as this script is capable of making it.<br /><br />Things escalate (so to speak) from here, with Jade becoming increasingly open about her dislike of the unseen freaks. Unfortunately, as an actor, Claire Brennan was as talented as she was attractive, and when she expresses her disgust she does so with a smile that she holds back with painful difficulty. Soon, Steve St. John catches Blackie after one of Jade's indiscretions, the two of them have a fight, and Blackie stabs Steve to death in a very brief and tame fight scene. Jade then inherits the freak show, and runs it with a cold heart, in contrast to Steve, who considered the freaks close friends of his.<br /><br />Anyway, eventually the freaks catch up to her and deform her in ways that are only possible in the movies, and she ends up becoming the bizarre and twisted creature shown in the SHE FREAK trailers and posters, and the movie ends. That's it. And believe me, this review is far more interesting than the actual movie itself, which should tell you something."
"31906_0.txt",36,"This has a kind of Japanese Sci Fi craziness to it and a wanna be Star Trek plot. Creative, silly, constantly surprising, if better known it would be a major cult movie perhaps it will be one now that it is getting a DVD release. This is a pretty large scale production with at least a thousand extras in one scene and some huge location work. The costumes are typically over colorful and practically pop off the screen. Add to all this a number of outlandish alien dance numbers, purple hair,live snakes, a splash of full frontal female nudity, and of course the evil Ronk--who looks like James Cameron did in 1985 and you have a must see. Almost every other scene has some totally crazy left turn moment or element you won't see coming. Also a bonus the strangeo music and goofy sound FX that go right along with the over the top acting and strange blocking. Actors will suddenly sit down on the floor in the middle of a scene while talking for no reason. Don't pass let this film pass you by."

This film delivers a series of good old fashioned exploitation shock effects as opposed to lengthy boring dialogue sequences followed by a mediocre ""bang"" for your four bucks.

The show is funnier for me today than when it first aired, mainly because I now understand that the main target were not children but people of more age, something that is relatively unknown. The show is wonderfully silly and smart, referencing itself constantly, spoofing Hollywood, breaking character and being as ""Brechtian"" as possible.

"24561_0.txt",40,"Overall, this movie was OK. The male lead actors all were very good and believable in their parts. The homosexuality was presented in a natural, matter-of-fact manner, instead of pedantic or problematic. The way the start of the aids era was captured was disturbing, but it seemed very realistic. There were some things in this movie that annoyed me however. First of all, the female characters. Depardieu is your typical withdrawn, a-sexual, artistic, female French cinema archetype. I can live with that though. Far more irritating was the presence of Beart, who was totally miscast. What is a blown-up plastic Barbie doll doing in a movie that is situated in the early eighties, when plastic surgery was not even properly born yet?? Her acting is (partly due to her renovated face) very flat and expressionless and it would have been better if she had been altogether left out. An other revealing mistake is the American guy/gay, who shows up in the last part of the movie; quite confusing when a character who is so proud of his multi-lingual talents has such a strong foreign accent when he speaks his mother tongue..."

"39519_0.txt",42,"First off the book Johnny Tremain is both one of the greatest children stories and one of the greatest revolutionary war novels ever written. Published during the Second World War it has never gone out of print since and rightly so. As source material it is perfectly suited to be given a movie adaption. And when the movie sticks to following the book it is rather entertaining in a 1950s Disney sort of way.<br /><br />The first half hour is close enough to the book to entertain the fans. The character of Johnny has been changed from arrogant and cocky to pure and innocent in the best tradition of Disney films which can hardly come as a surprise but to expect anything else out of a kid's movie is to be let down. The second half hour loses the mood but keeps near the plot. The Boston Tea Party is entertaining although the singing after it is unforgivably Disney. But by the last half hour the book is thrown to the winds as we see the war first hand. Something about seeing laughing children dancing around the countryside shooting at redcoats struck me as kind of disturbing for a Disney film. Obviously war was a great adventure that people could enjoy in a typical '50s fashion where nobody but the bad guys got hurt and everyone could share a nice drink afterward. Oh, and somebody who is supposed to die, whose death gives the entire book meaning, doesn't. That would be too dark for a Disney film.<br /><br />Now if I thought that any of those additions were beneficial to the movie I couldn't really complain but none of them worked. The first battle was alright but the psychotic killing kids having fun was just awful. The producers probably couldn't see why this might be considered 'creepy'. The acting from the lead is awful and he doesn't seem to have been in anything else afterward. The guy playing Rab seemed to bring a little of the distant charm described in the book but the script doesn't give him more than one or two moments. Walter Sande as Paul Revere was good as were a few of the founding fathers but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />On the plus side the sets are marvelous. I've never seen colonial Boston come to life so well since, largely due to an absence of Revolutionary War films. The Battle of Lexington is moderately well done rather obviously leaving open the question of who fired first. And the first half hour entertains. So in conclusion: good book, good sets, bad everything else. Remake anyone?"

The story revolves around a lot of different characters and their lives in the Nashville country music scene. I found all of these characters to be completely uninteresting and unlikable. I also found practically all of the music to be terrible. The only exception was ""Hard Ridin Cowboy Man"" which I liked, and for some unknown and confusing reason, that song is not even listed on the soundtrack. The rest of the movie just seemed to be a bunch of scenes scrapped together, with no plot or meaning. Maybe this is the kind of movie you need to watch more than once to appreciate, but I am not willing to give it another 3 hours of my time to find out."
"7056_0.txt",44,"It's obvious that the person with the negative view either expects a 'kung fu' film and didn't get it, or more likely never saw MR VAMPIRE...<br /><br />In order to enjoy this film I should think a little background on both Chinese mysticism and Hopping Zombie films are in order. <br /><br />I won't do either of the honors, but instead refer you to the Illuminated Lantern website where you can get at least a primer on both. <br /><br />AFA the film goes, I gave it a 7 out of 10 as it's a little disjointed, and lacks the flow of any really good Hopping Zombie film. But hey, at least someone whipped one of these out in the 00's, ten years after the genre died out. Kudos to Tsui Hark for that!"

"22608_0.txt",47,"Why did I rent this DVD? Well, I was driving down the road a couple months ago and decided to Google up my childhood best friend from when I was 11-12.... Eric Byler. I had tried to find him a few years back to no avail. You'll notice in the movie that Cody Chestnutt has a Little League patch on one shoulder and Lori (I believe) wears a baseball shirt at one point. That's no accident, as Eric was our #1 pitcher and we may have made it to the world series if he had not broken his finger in practice after we won the VA state title. To think that our team picture was on the cover of a phone book back in 1984... crazy! I visited him in Hawaii in 1986 and lost touch afterwords and remember his discussions of how the locals there treated him differently as a 'Hapa' (Eric's mother is full blood Asian, although she grew up in the same neighborhood with his father in the U.S.) Anyway, it is no surprise to me that Eric went into writing and directing. He was a very interesting and creative kid and I still have some of his cartoons and a fond memory of the Purple Flower Joke.<br /><br />As for the film, I can't give it extremely high marks, but it is very well made. See it if you want a different type of love story. My favorite low budget film is probably Blood Simple, which had both a love triangle and murder theme. The background music was really well done in that film and I give Eric very high marks for his scoring of CS."

I just thought it was so stupid that it was funny. I laughed through the part that the teeth attacked the guy in the recked van. Christopher Lloyd is pretty weird in this movie as well. Who ever thinks this movie is scary has never watched any movie that makes you jump. This I think is just a movie that doesn't even make sense to have even been made.

"49852_0.txt",52,"I'm a passionate advocate on behalf of German Expressionist films, especially from the silent era. I'm still bitter about an incident at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago, when an audience full of idiots (jaded by high-tech S/FX movies) laughed at the cardboard sets in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'. Those morons didn't care that the high degree of originality and imagination in 'Caligari' more than made up for its tiny production budget.<br /><br />'Shadows', however, while firmly within the Expressionist genre, is too arty for its own good. While this film does have some merits, its flaws greatly outnumber and exceed its merits.<br /><br />All the actors perform their roles with hand-to-brow histrionics of precisely the sort which have given silent-film acting a bad reputation. Several of the actors in this movie have given good performances elsewhere, so I assume that director Arthur Robison deserves the blame for their mannered theatrics here. During one scene, when a swain aims a punch at his rival, the actor cannot simply throw a punch: he must put his fist up against the other man's face, and then shove.<br /><br />Alexander Granach, as a showman with a shadow box and shadow puppets, demonstrates some extremely deft hand shadows, apparently with no other props supplementing his hands. But, when the puppet-master isn't performing, Granach lurches across the screen like Igor the hunchback. Ruth Weyher is pretty and graceful but is given no opportunity to behave like a human being.<br /><br />This silent film was originally released with no intertitles. Several other silent features also eschewed captions -- 'The Last Laugh', ""The Old Swimmin' Hole"", 'The Last Moment' -- but those films had linear plots which the audience could easily follow. The plot of 'Shadows' is deeply confusing, made even more confusing by the arty pretensions, and the story would have been far easier to follow with some captions. A curator at the Murnau Archiv has told me that 'Shadows' was given intertitles by several exhibitors when it was released outside Germany.<br /><br />The plot -- such as it is -- vaguely reminded me of Renoir's 'Rules of the Game' and Bergman's 'Smiles of a Summer Night': in a swank country manor, some people with more money than sense amuse themselves at each other's expense. But here the cast members are introduced in arty tableaux that are more alienating than edifying. After the final tableau, we're treated to the odd spectacle of a single upraised finger casting a shadow on the screen. What does this mean, please? Later, in hindsight, we understand that this signifies the beginning of the drama's Chapter One. (I saw this film in London, where the audience burst out laughing at the start of Chapter Two, symbolised by a hand with TWO upraised fingers: in Britain, this two-fingered gesture has obscene connotations.) The finger device is confusing, and adds nothing to the story ... nor does the decision to divide the narrative into arbitrary chapters.<br /><br />The production design is impressive: judging by the furniture and clothes, this story takes place somewhere in Europe (probably Germany) circa 1830: again, some titles would have helped. But Robison considerably weakens the effect of these wonderful costumes and sets by obscuring them with elaborate shadows, and by gimmicky effects such as raising and lowering a proscenium curtain in front of the actors. (As if we need to be reminded that this very artificial story is merely a story!) <br /><br />Considerable talent, effort and expense were put into 'Shadows', to little effect. Rather a lot of today's movie-goers are sadly prejudiced against silent films, misperceiving them all to be crude and laughably overacted. Sadly, 'Shadows' is precisely the sort of movie which would convince such people that all the negative stereotypes about silent movies are true after all. My rating for this failure: 2 out of 10, mostly for the production design."
"9378_0.txt",53,"It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever! I watch it about every 5-7 years. It's utterly fascinating, but it is so uncomfortable to watch at times I always wonder, as I am viewing it, why I put myself through this each time! The original movie, with Vincent Price, is ""dullsville"" compared to this re-make.<br /><br />Things can get really disgusting as Jeff Goldblum ('Seth Brundle"") slowly turns into a huge fly. The transformation is very gross in certain spots, and certainly gut-wrenching to witness. You can just feel his girlfriend's anguish and horror as she witnesses Goldblums' incredible physical and mental change. Geena Davis gives a convincing performance in that roles as ""Veronica Quiafe.""<br /><br />The story is not just a dumb horror-creature movie, but an intelligent science fiction tale with both leading actors excellent. I don't Davis ever looked prettier, too. John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, ""Stathis Borans."" Those three characters dominate the film. I can't even remember anyone else in here.<br /><br />The ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock. In fact, by the nd, this movie will have you emotionally worn out."
"7075_0.txt",54,"I felt a little uneasy here and there watching this flick, mostly due to the fact that I was watching it in a sort of 'viewing room' on a campus, where a bunch of TV's are set-up and people can watch whatever they want with headphones for the volume. Luckily, no one else entered the room- if so, I would probably have been reported for watching pornography, or snuff-film work, or both. I'm almost surprised this even came in the mail via netflix (though not that it didn't, apparently, get theatrical distribution here in the states). Of the only handful of Takashi Miike films I've seen, this does definitely take the cake. If it's maybe not his absolute best maybe it's part of the appeal; Miike is experimenting with the viewer's expectations, even his f****d up Japanese fan-type ones. It takes the idea of doing a tragic-comedy on a dysfunctional family and turns it on its head, and puts it across the line of what should usually be acceptable with absurdism, and either have the viewer be pleased (in a manner of speaking) or utterly disgusted, or both, that they went over the line.<br /><br />And what a family indeed. It starts off as being something, in its own way, almost quirky in the view of a family on the brink. There's infidelity at first- the father (Kenichi Endo), unintentionally video-tapes himself having sex with a certain girl. This is quite the graphic, uncomfortable sex scene, albeit with the most 'sensitive' parts being blurred, and this cuts right away to something completely different (if the Monty Python sound rings from reading that, it's not without some coincidence throughout the picture), as the father gets hit on the head by some guy with a rock. This guy, knick-named Q (Kazuchi Watanabe), comes to stay at the family's house, where the mother (Shungiki Uchida) gets whipped with a cane by her son, who on his way to and from school always without fail gets beaten and robbed by bullies. She's also into heroin, but then later when something happens particular-like with Q, another unnerving revelation is revealed, one without really any explanation for being there.<br /><br />But I realized after a while Miike set it up from the beginning with Q suddenly entering into this world, and somehow for no actual reason being accepted. In fact, if you're looking for reason, you might want to look elsewhere, seriously. It's a look at the disintegration of a family using a medium within its video-work (I was reminded of Godard's equally un-settling work of original sexually depraved and uncouth family in Numeroux Deux), and if taken really as being a serious work you might have to turn it off after a while. This is not something that I could easily do, however, as I had to watch what would happen much like in something in a Lynch or Bunuel film. It's actually not without some merit to compare him with those other filmmakers, as his work pushes the absurdism/surrealism to the brink, where there's no choice left but to laugh at what's going on. Take when the father decides to suddenly jump into his 'reality-TV' time by taping when the bullies shoot fireworks at their house. Or when things start getting particularly disturbing (necrophilia, yeah) and the juxtaposition of father to mother in these scenes is extraordinary in deranged comic timing.<br /><br />After it ended, with the final shot leaving a look on my face like a dog in front of a different piece of food in the bowl, I knew that Visitor Q is a work that goes beyond taking an ultra-serious look at the world of these psychotic criminals- or at the least social introverts and with sexual intentions that go over the edge- it worked a lot better than it might have at doing just a straightforward mockumentary of reality-TV. I'm not sure what the situation of the degrading medium is like in Japan, but by sticking to mocking this family and they're near-silent 'visitor', and putting it all through a blender of crimes and misdemeanors that would make some faint on the spot, Miike achieves his goals more or less, whatever they might be. It's got some scenes that don't work early on, or maybe its just so strange to really get into the mood of it at first. Once hooked in, I had as much fun, in the most perverse voyeuristic way, as I did with Ichi the Killer. It confronts the viewer, and should be deliciously shocking and unrepentantly hilarious for years to come. That it's not for everyone will be known right from the first scene."
"23986_0.txt",55,"I was sceptical at first because straight to video martial arts films tend to scream 'rubbish' from the front cover all the way to the final credits. But this film is certainly different. The story is beautifully basic and uncomplicated, yet never seems too simplistic or rehashed. A biomechanically augmented ex-assassin and wise cracking bar-fly hardly seem the most likely pair yet this film manages to pull it off as it follows them running from bounty hunters, police and various explosions alike. The star of the film is certainly Dacascos who demonstrates such physical ability on a par with the likes of Jet Li and Ong Bak's star Tony Jaa. Due to the low budget - which adds to rather than detracts from the style of the film - there's no CGI and wire work is clearly minimal. Kinetic, frenetic and beautiful are certainly words that describe the fight sequences in this film. Dacascos fits the part of an enhanced fighter with a speed reminiscent of Bruce Lee, and the varied and stylised arenas complement the action no end. I cant believe Hollywood didn't target Dacascos for the biggest projects, save Cradle II the Grave. Kareem Hardison is hilarious at times but also sometimes a distraction from Dacascos but his improvisations and ability to carry the story between the action cannot be overlooked. This film has everything you could want from a martial arts flick and smacks of Chinese influence despite being an Amercian project. The main reason this film is probably unheard of is that it was released at the same time as Rush Hour which was a big budget version of this film, in the sense it is an action comedy with African American/Chinese protagonists. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has seen Dacascos before as this is surly his finest film, and also to anyone that is intrigued by an American martial arts film that can hold its own against its Chinese counterpart."
"40203_0.txt",56,"I'm not familiar with Greenaway's other work; I mostly experienced this for Louis Andriessen's score (I'm a fan, and this isn't his best work, but it does have its moments). As for the film itself, let me say this: I like difficult art, and difficult cinema. I spend many hours justifying the existence of difficult art to others who are not quite so adventurous. I enjoy emotional distance and ambiguous meaning, taken even to Euro-trash extremes. And yet, I found this film to be the worst, most pretentious piece of crap I've ever seen in my life. It is very unattractive visually, and the film has dated very, very poorly in terms of its overall look. (Yes, you can tell this was made for TV...) Greenaway never knows when to get out of the way and let the images just breathe on their own... there is far too much information on screen at all times. If a first run through his completely awful text (which might pass as ""edgy prose"" in my junior high diary), set to Andriessen's music, wasn't enough for you, don't worry... he'll display the whole thing from start to finish in a slow side-scroll that features such high-tech effects as digitally-generated drop shadow. And his attempts at ""choreography"" are so banal in spots that you'll want to laugh out loud. Now I absolutely have to see another Greenaway film to see if they're all this bad. As for yourself, don't bother."
"20879_0.txt",57,"During last year's visit to the Hong Kong International Film Festival, it gave me an opportunity to take in first hand and provide for some exposure to Chinese films, specifically those that were made in China. Amongst those that I've seen, I was blown away by the quality of storytelling and craft, and had wondered how soon after would I have the chance to watch something from China again, since our local cinemas don't really bring them in for mass consumption. Hence, this film festival was like a godsend, putting together some classics of the past, together with contemporary offerings from the new generation of directors. The Festival name might be a mouthful, but its objective is no doubt succinct - to introduce us to the magic of Chinese cinema once again.<br /><br />Electric Shadows opens the festival, and by and large I've heard some really good things about it. The DVD has been available for some time already, but procrastination meant not picking it up, so having it screened as the opening film was no excuse anymore to miss it. And it's no surprise that I fell in love with director Xiao Jiang's first film, which is one with such a compelling story and fine acting, I would think one would likely have a heart of stone not to like it for some reason.<br /><br />The film's opening introduces us to the character of Mao Dabing (Xia Yu), a water delivery boy who spends the bulk of his wages watching movies in the cinemas. I chuckled at this obvious identification, of someone spending his free time at the movies, and being completely lost in them as a form of escapism from the mundane repetitiveness and perhaps loneliness in his day job. While we follow his point of view for the most part at the beginning, that perspective shifted to a mute girl he encounters, who for no reason pounded his head with a brick, and destroyed his company sponsored bicycle. Persuaded to help her look after her fish while she has to inevitably get detained by the authorities, Dabing thought that he had reached seventh heaven when her apartment turned out to be one huge home theatre.<br /><br />From there, the pace picks up, and we're transported to some 30 years back into the Cultural Revolution, and rewinds a little bit to the earlier generation. Electric Shadows has a bit of everything, even though some might like to compare it to Cinema Paradiso, I thought that this film had merits to stand on its own two feet despite the obvious comparison. It is its own movie, and while episodic, it never felt disjointed or had portions out of place, but gelled together seamlessly to weave an epic adventure of the story of a young girl Ling Ling, born at an outdoor cinema, and had cinema to be her companion during her formative years. As always, it's the mothers, here Jiang Xuehua (Jiang Yihong) an actress wannabe, who played a huge role in her appetite for films, and for her philosophy to lead a life with their heads held high because of her single parent status, leading to Ling Ling being quite a feisty little girl.<br /><br />It was a time where film screenings were communal in attendance and experience, in small towns where close knit villagers have that as common mass entertainment. Electric Shadows managed to capture the social and cultural climate of the times, and best of all, had a tremendous number of clips to snapshot various cinematic oldies and gems that you would be tempted to check out should you have the opportunity to do so, one of which is Shining Red Star which will be screened this Saturday. Against this backdrop, Ling Ling leads quite an eventful life, where the pace catapults with the introduction of Mao Xiaobing (Wang Zhengjia), a scruffy kid from out of town whose mischievousness brings trouble, but for their love of movies which brought them together to be best frien uds forever, even though he prefers the action genre where he can make-belief he's the star of the show.<br /><br />Electric Shadows is such a charming film that you'd find it hard to believe it's actually a first film, balancing drama, comedy and tragedy even with great aplomb, although there were some series of coincidences in the events and characters that you'll find it easy to ignore for the whole movie to work. It's strength also came from the wonderful cast who brought their likable characters to life, and you cannot find better chemistry between the cast members even when some of them take up the same characters albeit for different age groups. You'll feel for mother Xuehua in her resignation to the bad hand Fate had dealt her, you marvel at the dedication of Pan Daren (Li Haibin) the projectionist, you laugh and cry at the antics of the children, especially those of Xiaobing and Bing Bing (Zhang Haoqi) the kid brother who seemed to possess such maturity in his innocence. <br /><br />It's been a long time since I was moved so immensely moved by a single film, and I'm glad that Electric Shadows shone brightly through and cemented its place in my mental list of all time favourite movies. With amazing cinematography and locales, and a score as performed by the China Philharmonic Orchestra, this is a must watch, a truly exquisite film to sit through, well worth your time and one for repeated viewings. I'm getting the DVD!"
"10014_0.txt",58,"James Cagney is always a delight to watch, even when he's playing a pompous and disgusting pig like Marty Snyder. If you don't agree with that statement, you may have a hard time taking in Love Me Or Leave Me, because Cagney's character is about as unlikeable as leading men come. I know next to nothing about Snyder's non-fiction life, but if we are to believe his composite in this film, the dude must have been completely lacking redeeming qualities of any kind.<br /><br />Of course, Cagney himself is well known as one of the nicest, most decent human beings who ever worked in Hollywood, so the fact that he so effectively channels Snyder's loathsome persona certainly demonstrates the actor's tremendous skills. If you've seen any of Cagney films, you're probably used to those, but his ability to own every scene he's in despite the fact that the audience is destined to abhor his character shows very clearly how fully Cagney leaped into every performance he undertook. <br /><br />Doris Day is not one of my favorite actresses of the classic era, but she is excellent here. Perhaps I just hadn't seen her at her best until now, but after witnessing her show-stopping Zigfield Follies number here, I'm a believer. It's hard to sell her as a sympathetic character, especially watching her maintain her timid vigil under Snyder's dominating and abusive umbrella, but the film explores their volatile relationship in such depth, some semblance of understanding creeps through. This is not your traditional love story however, and in fact that emotion seems to have very little to do with the pairing on the screen in Love Me Or Leave Me. The film instead essays a very peculiar mutual dependency, and it's a fascinating relationship to digest in the hands of these two gifted actors, both of whom make every scene they share sizzle as they play off of each other.<br /><br />A substantial number of musical performances pad the running time, and it could be argued that some could have been omitted for the sake of streamlining the story. But the songs serve as external monologues in which Day fills in the emotional gaps in her character's psyche, and paying close attention to the words reveals a lot about the unspoken undercurrent of alternating disgust and devotion that seems to have classified this co-dependent arrangement. Luckily, all of the music is excellent, and Day's performances are all top notch. Whether we're seeing her headline elaborate stage numbers or simply rehearsing by the piano, her plain but effective vocal delivery always seethes with emotion.<br /><br />Though the film is definitely dated, it has aged quite well. Today's audiences will likely note the casual misogyny that runs rampant throughout the film, which was so prevalent in early Hollywood and was somehow accepted as part of popular culture. Those not familiar with this phenomenon may be a bit shocked by what they see here, but if we put it in context with the times and consider what a woman's role was traditionally considered in the era, it's not off-putting to see Day endure these verbal and emotional attacks without retaliation. It certainly doesn't dilute the strength of her performance, or the character for that matter, and knowing that it wasn't considered socially proper for a woman to talk back to her fella in those days adds yet another layer of complexity to the fabric of this union. We know there will come a point where Day finally can't take anymore, and watching her soak up each new trespass while being forced to bottle her emotions allows us to truly be engulfed by the inner turmoil of this woman whose dreams are coming true, even as her life away from the stage is a nightmare.<br /><br />This is an engrossing character study on both sides, and Day and Cagney are both in top form here. If that alone isn't enough to persuade you to watch this film, I'm at a loss to provide a better selling point."
"12796_0.txt",59,"In the hands of experimental Japanese filmmaker Nobuhiko Obayashi, the tale of seven ""unmarried"" young high-school girls who, during a school break, travel to a spooky, remote hilltop house to visit the reclusive, mysterious Aunt of one of their fold only to be consumed one at a time by the Ghost-House/Aunt in increasingly novel ways, is escalated into a spastic, phantasmagorical confetti burst of avant-garde techniques and tonalities. Not a minute goes by without some kind of imaginative and spirited experimental visual manipulation or interjection; from kaleidoscopic color schemes, to frame and time altering collage montage, to wild, high-concept mixed media integration (animation, mattes, props, sets, etc), to mini-movie injections (lovingly parodying/mimicking everything from silent film stylistics, to romantic fantasies to obligatory action scenes). Any and all workings of the film form are here incorporatedly warped; from imagery and editing to music and sound to content and presentation. Even the sketches of characters and their respective performances by the actors are hemmed in time with the overall off-the-wall configuration. (Example: Each girl is intentionally drawn with their stock personalities (the musician, the over-weight eater, the athlete, etc) novelly paraded in gleeful iconic irreverence.) The moods and tones of the film are equally melodic in their own discordant tangential way; seamlessly walking the line between comedy, horror and the deadpan aloof. It all adds up to a whole lot of fun. Where else could you see a girl eaten by a piano, an upright Bear helping cook dinner at a roadside noodle-stand or a man turned into a pile of bananas because he doesn't like melons!?

"17527_0.txt",60,"Telling about the years from his fateful first encounter with the Castro brothers in Mexico to the end of the revolution, The Argentine helps show how a young doctor became a Comandante respected and loved by a nation that was not even his. This was a man with ideals, one who believed in the love of humanity, justice, and truth. He was a doctor above all else, patching up the troops and making sure the people in every village they passed through had the care and attention they needed. He also was not afraid to lead the charge and stand at the frontlines without fear of death. One must live as though they have already died, then the fear will be gone and you can do what is necessary for the cause. It is about the group and the country, not about his survival. In his idealized communist beliefs he was fighting for Cuba and the only outcomes allowed were victory or his own destruction.<br /><br />Soderbergh's ambitions are evident right from the start. Although it mainly concerns the years between 1955-1962, he splices in events happening later on as Che visits the UN. Shot in black and white to help juxtapose against the sumptuous colors of our main action, these future scenes comment on what is happening during the war, cutting in to enhance the tale. There is a lot of structural jumping between the years, each change titled with a date and place to orient us as the viewers. The technique lends a more modern artistic scope to what would otherwise be a linear narrative and I believe helps tell the story more coherently. He has edited the film for the most efficient portrayal of the facts, a somewhat cause and effect relationship to better let us understand the situation. And it is a beautifully shot film, lending a fly on the wall type feel as we follow the revolutionaries or watch the UN debate. It is less artifice than an account of what happened based on the memoirs of Guevara himself. All the battles and all the victories from start to finish, his own uphill advancement through the ranks, from doctor to right-hand man, instructor of new recruits to leader of an army. However, if this film is to be believed, Che never wanted the power past being able to get the job done. Once Cuba was free he wanted to bring the revolution to all of Latin America, to share his experiences and political viewpoints. An intelligent man, he is shown fighting for his beliefs, no matter the cost. Unafraid to do what was needed meant he was unafraid to kill. Does a man like that deserve to be glorified in a film like this? That is in the eye of the beholder because to some he was a hero and a patriot, but like every conflict in history, where there is a good side there is a bad. To view a battle objectively is impossible because there will always be someone to defend it and someone else to protest.<br /><br />The Argentine is one that will make you think about the strength of the mind and the power of ideas. A country came together and helped back a revolt with force to take over the government. With the charismatic and understated performance from Benicio Del Toro as Che, one can't help but see why. Always with a smile and a kind word, he ruled with respect and without compromising his beliefs. The fact that he leads intellectually makes the moments of outburst that much more effective. The role should garner a lot of praise as he embodies the man completely, shedding any preconceptions of the actor himself. Demotions and promotions don't apply during his tenure in the army, he does what Castro needs him to do; he follows his leader and expects the same from those under him. He portrays this man as one to be listened to and taken seriously. Castro himself holds council and values his ideas, and one might say that if Fidel was the face of the revolt, the man pulling the strings, Che was the muscle, the force allowing it all to happen.<br /><br />In the end, though, while the visuals are gorgeous and the acting superb, it is the story that leaves a little something to be desired. Structurally interesting and easier to follow than one might think due to the jumps in time, we are not shown all the details. Often times we are thrown directly into the action without knowledge of why we are there or what is happening for what reason. Events occur and we are shown flashes, learning details after the fact or never at all. An example is when Che all of a sudden needs a cast for his arm. We don't know what happened, another character actually asks him, but when the answer is about to be said, we cut to another scene. Soderbergh seems to have crafted the tale he wanted to, only allowing us to see what he deems important, while leaving all other details by the wayside. He paints Guevara in a kind light, as a warrior with a purpose, never putting himself in front of the mission or country. In that regard the film is about the Argentine, but on the whole it is really about the war itself. Why is Batista bad? Why is Castro good? None of that matters. This isn't a history lesson showing the reasoning or rationale, you can get that in a book. Instead Soderbergh is just sharing the events themselvesas they happen, not why. You can't deny the scale or ambitions on display, however, the lack of background may make it hard to decipher, or even hard to really care."
"3987_0.txt",61,"Not much of a thriller, Juncture is a beautiful drama that also raises questions of moral importance. <br /><br />Lead Kristine Blackport (as Anna Carter) sometimes gives you the shudder. She makes you feel what Anna would feel if were in her place. <br /><br />Plot: Anna Carter is informed by her doctor that she has three months to live because she suffers from frontal-lobe Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). Tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in personality, thus the question whether her decision to kill child-molesters and other criminals is a matter of choice or of psychiatric nature hangs unanswered. As the plot goes forth, the moral and philosophical issues arising are inevitable, and the surprising end is a statement you can't forget. <br /><br />I liked it very much."
"27459_0.txt",62,"The Living Dead Girl is one of the worst horror films ever because it has nothing to offer the audience, not even schlock or eerie premises, what passes as ""gore"" is supposed to douse us with some appreciation of this awful film, and yes, it is terrible. Rollin made this simply to cash in on nude horror films, but it doesn't have any atmosphere, story or fright to propel it along and most of the naked women are dead dull ugly. Continuity errors, cheap make up and effects, mics in the shot, film crew shadows and excessive lighting also ruin it beyond imagination. The pacing by all accounts is tediously slow, Rollin drags us through lurid shots and fake eye gougings and rotten acting that wouldn't pass a low budget play. The problem of the film is that it is not interesting, nor even believable, and he neglects to give us any truly frightening moments, instead he overloads us with distracting and annoying fake blood and fully naked waif-like 70's girls who are hideous to behold. There is no story, just one scene after another that is comprised of the Dead Girl looking for more idiotic victims and tons of shots comprised of the boring French provinces shown in wide angles, including a lackluster French band playing corny music. The ending is incredulous and the whole thing is a wasted effort from a limited director."

"32747_0.txt",65,"This was the most appalling adaptation of a story I have seen in quite some time. It does violence to the fundamental story line of LeGuin's books--no wonder she has publicly distanced herself from it.<br /><br />For one thing, Ged (that's his true name, by the way, and everyone on Earthsea has them) is not a petulant teenager. He is impetuous, but not petulant. There was also no Christian subtext in the books. Ged did not rise from the dead; he was re-born when he received his true name, but that happened when he was seven, and is something he shares with every other Archipelagan.<br /><br />The people of the Archipelago are red-brown to black. They are not pasty Chlorox white. A series that had non-whites as its protagonists was a rare thing in the sixties and seventies--whites don't need to appropriate this one now.<br /><br />The God-King was not trying to conquer all of Earthsea in order to conquer death. He does not succeed in an attack on Roke, and he does not knife the Archmage. <br /><br />Normally, I understand the compromises necessary to translate a book to a film. The two move at different paces and have different story telling needs. So if dialogue wanders, or secondary plots disappear--fine, so long as the original author's intent and main story line are preserved. This adaptation (in which the producer, Robert Halmi, claimed to speak for Ms. LeGuin (and called her ""miss""--MISS, to a woman who has been in the forefront of feminism for over thirty years!!!!!!!)) did not even maintain the same story or the same intent. LeGuin has noted that the whole story revolves around two young people coming into their power--and the responsibilities and problems thereof. There was none of that in this story. For shame, anyone responsible for decisions about this film: you did terrible work this time around."

To begin with, if you see the 2 movies one after the other like i did, you'll save a lot of your valuable time playing it in fast forward, since this Part 2 has about 40 minutes with footage from the first one.

It's so bad U have to see it for yourselves! Take a good look to his evil laughter and to the eyebrows! I believe his eyebrows act better than him! For real!<br /><br />And the plot? Well, the plot is just what you're expecting for! After his parents death, and later his brother's (in the first movie), he became so disturbed that starts killing everyone who crosses his path, or blows his nose to a red handkerchief!

"44766_0.txt",70,"You may like the movie or not, it's an obvious matter of taste and individual sensibility. Better said, you may like so much the message conveyed that you give it a ten. I gave this movie a five. In my opinion, to give a ten, cinema art qualities should be taken into account, like camera work, or robustness of plot, which allows for ellipses, or smartness of the screenplay. All this is missing in this movie. If a character runs for his life let him run till the viewer also is breathing heavily. The message itself is vague, no technical details (in such a technological subject) to give it substance. A horror film may have a ten if it is perfectly done, and possibly teaches the viewer a better understanding of the human behavior. Ideals and spirituality are harder to convey. Somebody did it, a good job indeed, with very plain examples."
"34291_0.txt",71,"I'm really on the fence about this movie. Though the score is wonderful and melodic, it is often interrupted by cheap directorial tricks. The ballad ""Isn't It Romantic"" would have been lovely if it had been performed straight, with no flounces. Instead it is truncated, and for me, ruined by cinematic tricks. ""Lover,"" a superb Richard Rodgers waltz, is sung to a horse, the late Jeanette MacDonald halting her rendition to make jokes with the animal! There are many other examples of film fireworks that fizzle. Perhaps Mamoulian was anxious to show how a movie musical could be superior to the stage, but for me all that emerges are unwelcome and dated film artifices that serve only to annoy. I get the feeling that Mamoulian didn't really like the score and tried his best to submerge it. Though I'm still on the fence, I really detested this film."
"1430_0.txt",72,"This one could have easily been called LITTLE LOST PANZER ON THE RANGE, and is a nearly brain dead but nonetheless enjoyable Spaghetti Western masquerading as a war thriller. Since Spaghetti Westerns are essentially cartoons for grown-ups, I can see how BATTLE OF THE LAST PANZER has confused many viewers into thinking it a failure. There are no ""good guys"" in this movie (a quality shared with Spaghetti), but there are no real ""bad guys"" either, which is perhaps the movie's biggest flaw -- it's hard to figure out whom exactly one should be rooting for, but one of the characters helpfully states straight out the movie's agenda: There are no good or bad nations, only good or bad men. A worthy and romantic conclusion to be sure but in direct conflict with the traditional role that Germans play in mainstream WW2 movies, which is to be the villains. Just ask Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />So like Umberto Lenzi's DESERT COMMANDOS, here is a low budget pre- DAS BOOT war movie that asks us to consider the German soldiers as people with the same kind of good/bad dualities that exist within even the most noble of us. ""Stan Cooper"" plays a more or less straight-laced young German Lt. in command of what is portrayed as the last functioning Panzer tank still fighting World War II, cut off from German lines after a devastating ambush knocks out all of the other Panzers in his column retreating from Normandy after the allied D-Day invasion, the German war effort obviously lost beyond any hope & the Nazis in a near panic as defeat looms. The majority of the film depicts Cooper and his crew roaming the faux-French countryside -- which will look eerily familiar to anyone who has seen at least three Spaghetti Westerns, since most were filmed on the same Spanish exterior locations -- encountering various indigenous locals, fighting off allied elements, and contemplating the meaning of service, loyalty, the value of life, and the price of failure to follow orders. The usual stuff, competently staged & filmed by true professionals. Whether or not the tanks or other equipment used are historically accurate is irrelevant: get over it. This is a well made movie, even if incredibly stupid if you stop to think about it.<br /><br />Regardless, all of that works pretty well until the film stumbles when the element of a woman is arbitrarily interjected, and Cooper finds himself falling in love with a hostage (blond Erna Schürer, a classic beauty in every sense of the term) who has volunteered to lead the wayward tank crew back to German lines. Skirmishes with odd looking war surplus garbed Partisans and headline Gringo star Guy Madison's ineffectual American brigade kill time and raise the body count, punctuated by a fascinating combat sequence where director Jose Luis Merino -- best known for his Gothic Horror thrillers -- colors his film with nearly opaque red and blue filters. Another interesting moment comes when Cooper is allowed access to the body of his new lust-thang and the thought of his men, his mission, and the danger they are in causes a certain amount of post traumatic stress disorder coitus interruptus, much to the annoyance of his would be squeeze. The romance subplot is perhaps the film's other major flaw but it does allow for some dimension to be added to the character of this zealous, ultra-loyal German officer and leads to the eventual cracking of his surface to let some of the humanity come through.<br /><br />But the ending is almost an unforgivable cop-out, a seemingly arbitrary ""War Is Hell"" moment added to show viewers the futility of it all, in case we missed the point on our own & were having fun. In the end Merino's message seems to be that war isn't fun but it can be entertaining for others to watch, especially if you can get your hands on a big, cool looking working tank, a pretty girl or two and some moments of choreographed destruction. The final tank battle is actually very reminiscent of a show down on the streets of a dusty Western town between the hero & the villain, and Merino chose to have the two tanks be identical to sort of tell us that one is just like the other, like Radio Raheem's LOVE and HATE knuckle dusters from DO THE RIGHT THING. It's not the most profound insight into human character ever to pop up in a war movie, but in this case it will have to do.<br /><br />All in all the movie goes on for about 10 minutes longer than it should have, and while the story is involving for sure it never really resonates on the emotional level that the subject matter would usually endow on a film. So it really is almost a pure example of how the Euro cult genre directors re-tooled their Spaghetti Western approach to ape war movies for the brief period of time (1968 to 1970 or so) that this strange little ""Euro War"" genre was all the rage, and stands as an instructive example of the process at work. Fans of the Euro B-movie scene from the 1960's/1970's will be well served by taking a look, but anyone in search of a history lesson might want to just see what's on the History Channel. That's not what these movies were made for, and holding it accountable for failing to rise to a standard imposed upon it by a future generation with different social mores isn't fair.<br /><br />7/10; look for it on one of those bargain priced multi-disc DVD box sets for about $9, and make up your own mind."
"41097_0.txt",73,"There isn't much new I can add about this film. Take everything negative from the other reviewers and multiply it by ten. Whichever angle I look at it from (script, camera, acting, story, etc.), I can't say anything positive about it. The most incredible thing is that JB took on this role! What was she thinking!? Perhaps a new title ""Die ALREADY!"" would help. If you like art-house, DON'T watch this movie. If you DON'T like art-house, definitely give it a miss. The Teletubbies have more substance than this fart-house production. You've been warned. Go and have a root-canal procedure instead - it will be a pleasant experience in comparison."
"28323_0.txt",74,"This is a fair to reasonable movie about a recluse experiencing strange sights and phenomenon in her apartment. How can she leave when she's more terrified of going out? Claustrophobic in its execution, it turns into a ghost story instead of delving into whether the things happening or just illusions are just in her mind, but therein is the motivation of the script. Where it falls apart for me is the introduction of the pseudo-intellectual ghost-hunter more interested in selling gear and a lot of paranormal mishmash, none of which makes sense or is close to the real thing, but then for the sake of story-telling, film-makers rarely care about keeping it real. Cute and attractive, Jillian Byrnes gives a very good performance, and the directing style keeps in atmosphere throughout, but like I said, it is only in the plot and how believable it is that I find fault. Does the movie have its scares? Yes, but they are from the talent of the director working with the material given him by the writer."
"49320_0.txt",75,"To put it simply: a lack of respect. GAME OF DEATH: THE ROBERT CLOUSE VERSION ranks (in two senses of the word) right alongside Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Clouse and Wood weren't the first graverobbers on the scene, to be sure, but they both came away from the boneyard with unclean hands. Like Burke and Hare, they was just lookin' to pocket some loose change. Which they did. Nor were they alone. Years after the fact, DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY (based, we're told, on Clouse's own book) would come along and reopen the old wound(s). Like most Bruce Lee fans, I suffered through the seemingly endless exploitation cycle that began the moment he died. It wasn't easy, because not a single one of the purported bioflix came anywhere near the Truth. DRAGON likewise created its own distorted ""reality,"" with yet another wannabe look-alike choreographed through yet more over-the-top, badly done fight scenes that did nothing more than add yet another layer of tarnish to the memory of a man who deserves better. GAME OF DEATH is an insult to the intelligence. Now that we have BRUCE LEE: A WARRIOR'S JOURNEY, there's no need to even go back and revisit this one."
"35031_0.txt",76,"What the ...? That's all I can really say as an introduction. I have little to no idea why this film was made and if the director honestly thought men would find Chesty Morgan an erotic performer. Maybe this was all one big prank, ala Andy Kaufman. Who knows. All I can say is that this is one of the most bizarre, inane, and insane sexploitation films ever made. I haven't seen ""Deadly Weapons"" but apparently its even worse (if thats possible). This is something akin to watching a freak show.<br /><br />I should mention Chesty Morgan around now. This is a woman with a bust that made Anita Ekberg look like Winona Ryder. Chesty was a stripper with an all natural 73 inch bust. I'm a fan of well endowed women, but that is just a bit too much for the average man's liking I would suspect. Seeing her naked is an absolutely disgusting experience. Thats why the film is appealing however. Its so gross and so stupid it becomes a painfully funny viewing experience, a real cinematic train wreck in which nothing seems to be competently done. Attempting to explain the plot would be in vain, because this film was made solely to concentrate on Chesty's breasts.<br /><br />As fascinating as Chesty is, a good deal of what makes this film so bizarre is Doris Wishman, the director. Allegedly the most prolific female filmmaker of all time, she was certainly an unique auteur. The low budget is more painfully obvious in this than most pornography. Because of issues with post-dubbing, Wishman had a tendency to concentrate on random objects (animals and furniture being a particular favorite) whenever a character is talking. Also, she would use the same room for multiple sets. That's why the spy headquarters in the film look like a used car salesman's office. If you want to see an almost competently made film of her's (meaning its a good film with bad production values), check out ""Bad Girls Go to Hell"". ""Double Agent 73"" is of interest to any vintage exploitation fan. (2/10)"
"12981_0.txt",77,"I had my doubts, but was surprised and pleased that Blue Smoke was much better than my expectations.<br /><br />Using flashbacks was a more effective way of presenting Reena's past and present in the movie. It helped create the picture of who she had become and why. I could understand many of the changes made to accommodate the transition from book to film. In some cases preferred the movie version (the book had a LOT of graphic violence).<br /><br />Alica Witt did a very believable strong, fierce Reena, showing how she had grown to deal with the tragedies that had made her feel, understandably, vulnerable and fragile. Scott Bakula ... ah ... he just gets better and more seasoned with every new role he takes on: compassionate and kind, but stern and demanding when needed.<br /><br />The relationships before she met Bo were as heartbreaking in the movie as in the book. Though I couldn't decide if the one she had with Hugh was even sadder than the original version. Was it worse that she was gun-shy and only on the brink of a new, deeper relationship as in the book, or taking the chance of accepting a marriage proposal as in the film? <br /><br />I honestly didn't think I'd like Matthew Settle as Bo, but he convinced me with his scene in the backyard when he *finally* got to meet his dream girl.<br /><br />The strong sense of family, and how their love and respect for each other also helped form Reena into such a determined, focused woman was carried through in both versions. <br /><br />Personally, I thought how the movie dealt with the villain(s) was a nice twist and fitting ending.<br /><br />Leaves me champing at the bit to see Carolina Moon."
"39309_0.txt",78,"When I saw the first Santa Clause at the age of 10 it had set the standard for Christmas movies for me. Nearly a decade later I could understand why they brought out a sequel - Disney is no longer doing a feature film per summer and they need to pay rent. I saw it anyway and it was exactly what I expected it to be.<br /><br />The third film I went to see with my girlfriend at a dollar theater and still walked out feeling like I wasted two bucks.<br /><br />Tim Allen didn't appear to give a damn about this movie other than that it's going to pay his cell phone bills for the next three months. Martin Short, as someone else had mentioned, is an acquired taste -- a taste that I do not care for and actually found somewhat annoying. I couldn't believe the original Neil, Laura, and Charlie were brought back though I felt they were used as filler characters more than anything. They didn't have any kind of situation or purpose in the movie other than to become victims of Jack Frost's Polar Ice breath. Santa Claus seemed to enjoy the company of his ex-wife much more so than his current one. The omission of Bernard is inexcusable. The ""legendary characters"" was a bit much and didn't add to the story, especially the Easter Bunny's horrible 70's Wookie costume. The kids playing the elves didn't even look thrilled to be there, regardless of who was playing Santa. The set from the first movie was huge -- outside looked like a dark, expansive glacier and indoors was a gigantic toy workshop. In this movie the outdoor set looked more like the sunny, bubbly Dr. Seuss Land at Islands of Adventure, and anything indoors was inconceivably tiny and elf-like, completely ignoring the fact that the ""head elf"", Santa, is a full-sized man.<br /><br />The special effects were far worse than the first movie 12 years ago. In the first movie, the producer actually cared about the outcome and therefore sunk a large sum of money into the best special effects at the time. SC3 showcases every possible SFX shortcut. The CGI reindeer were pathetic -- the cartoony Scooby Doo eyes were just stupid. Just goes to show you that the art of puppeteering is gone for good. The ""magic snow globe"" looked like a novelty souvenir bought at a convenience store. Santa's sleigh looked like a poorly-built plywood prop. A lot of the sound effects were textbook cartoon fare...for a cartoon made 50 years ago. These kinds of details do not go unnoticed.<br /><br />The filmmakers even had the audacity to use actual cut-scenes from the first movie - about 90 seconds worth - which to me is pretty tacky; seems like they just needed some more filler.<br /><br />The entire movie is supposed to be a story being told by Mrs. Claus to her classroom but the introduction was so short I forgot all about that. I thought the movie was ending just as it cut back to the classroom with about 3 more minutes of movie. I'm glad I stayed for the Buddy Claus scene though - the generic baby with a red scarf on his head was the star of this scene.<br /><br />This movie was so dumbed down it's unbelievable. Seeing the first movie at the young age I did of course I wasn't going to understand some of the adult humor. As I grew up, though, it was a lot of fun to understand some of the jokes that I had missed as a kid, which is what's so appealing about that movie. In SC3, if a 6 year-old fails to understand something it's because he's had some kind of unfortunate mental handicap.<br /><br />The storyline's been described so many times by other members it's not worth it for me to go into. What I haven't seen anybody mention, however, is that this is a Christmas movie featuring Santa Claus on Christmas Eve and there is barely any mention of delivering toys to kids, much less any kind of action taken in preparation to do so. It's small, I know, but again it's the details.<br /><br />Just chalk it up as another crappy Disney sequel."

The young boy, who in the past suffered a deeply traumatic experience by watching his father kill his mother, initially gets along well with his new therapist; moreover, Dr. Hunter himself seems to draw comfort from the boy's presence, as he reminds him of his lost son. However, things gradually become more complicated, as Tommy and Shelly (Cordellini), the daughter of Dr. Hunter, meet and become fond of each other; moreover, Tommy's case is not as simple as it first seemed...<br /><br />The film portrays three troubled characters: Kyle, Tommy, and Hunter himself. The performances by the respective actors, namely Blumas, Kartheiser, and Garcia, are simply superb. Although one might expect such A-level acting by a star of Andy Garcia's caliber, it is positively surprising and very heartening to watch young actors doing such a good job. Cordellini is also very convincing as Hunter's detached and confused daughter, while the rest of the cast remains on a generally satisfactory level.<br /><br />McLoughlin's direction is balanced and well-executed, building up the tension when he should, but without resorting to needless exaggerations.<br /><br />""The Unsaid"" is overall a solid film that studies the secrets buried inside the human soul. 7/10."

I cried, too, as he so believably yearned to be with his dad.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is how intriguing the action sequences are. Not only are the usual chase scenes exciting, but the interesting psychological aspects of the movie also work extremely well.<br /><br />If you have not seen Frequency, please do so, it is an excellent movie and I doubt you will regret seeing it. Although seeing it in a theater is the ideal place, the DVD is almost the same. You should enjoy this movie, it is a true classic, and I know I will never tire of watching it."
"48129_0.txt",86,"With a voice dub from the always awesome Bruce Campbell, oodles of ""cult classic"" comments/reviews, and a DVD release from Anchor Bay, you'd be led to believe this is truly a lost gem resurfaced. Wrong, wrong, WRONG.<br /><br />Give a 18-ish man-boy (J.R. Bookwalter) two weeks worth of grocery money and let him indulge his crippled ""genius"" through a Super-8, and this is what you get. Every minute of this movie is saturated in ineptitude. The plot is unimaginative to the extreme, the gore is laughable, the acting is beyond HORRIBLE, and the original actors voices have been clumsily dubbed back in (why???) complete with loads of woodenness.<br /><br />Looking for something more specific? How about that most of the characters in this movie have names like Raimi, Carpenter, Savini, etc., and get this- The zombie loving cult leader's name is Rev. Jones. Wow, how original; must have taken weeks to come up with that one. The ""sets"" are a real joy to behold too. Double-wides, abandoned houses, and a high school serve oh-so-realistically as hi-tech labs, government offices and a cult headquarters. Get the idea? <br /><br />""TDND"" isn't low-budget- It's NO-budget and worthless in every aspect. Bookwalter is still at it today, nearly twenty years later, and is just as talent deprived (ie- Ozone) as he was when this piece of trash first came out. Surprise, surprise.<br /><br />(The 1 star- It's for Campbell.)"
"26770_0.txt",87,"Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his ""friend"",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their ""big night"". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking."
"21317_0.txt",88,"My Take: The best of the Tom Clancy adaptations. <br /><br />Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan, and you better believe it. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is the third adaptation of yet another Tom Clancy bestseller, spawned by the success of the previous Clancy adaptations THE HUNT FOR RED October and PATRIOT GAMES. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, like the previous films, successfully thrills their audiences with exciting sequences that, also, manages to stay plausible and never too unbelievably silly. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER may not have succeeded to become a total thrill-ride, but in the end it delivers its political message well. It's a slightly long, but thrilling and exciting Clancy adaptation. <br /><br />Once again, Ford returns as Jack Ryan, who is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence, when CIA Deputy James Greer (James Earl Jones) is ill with cancer. His first mission: To investigate the death of one of the President's closest friends, who has connections with drug cartels. Ryan, once again, fights for what he believes is the truth, unknown to him that the National Security Adviser (Harris Yulin) has already dispatched mercenary elite troops, led by field operator John Clark (Willem Dafoe), on a covert operation in Columbia. <br /><br />But even if you don't get involved with the story or haven't read any of Tom Clancy's bestselling techno-thrillers (like myself), you must admit how exciting, edgy and believable this film is. Once more, it's also well-written on the screen and don't get wasted. When the film doesn't stun you with its action sequences devised by director Phillip Noyce and his crew of cinematographers and stunt directors, it involves you in the political situations made real and plausible by the adapted script by Donald Stewart, John Millius and Steven Zallian. Honestly, the sequences that involves Ryan arguing with the President of the United States are just as good to watch as the films more exciting sequences (The memorable ambush sequence and the RAMBO-esquire finale are the first to come to mind).<br /><br />Even if the film isn't exactly the total ""keeps you on the edge of your seat"" action thriller, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER delivers its political message as well as thrilling excitement all in the same show. <br /><br />Rating: ***** out of 5."
"3447_0.txt",89,"This has to be the worse C movie I've ever seen. It looks and sounds like someone filmed it with their home camcorder. A couple of the death scenes are tolerable but the acting ruins it. Lots of continuity problems. I paid $1.50 to rent, got ripped off. Avoid at all costs."
"32191_0.txt",90,"A radiant Claudette Colbert stars in this first version of ""Imitation of Life"" along with Louise Beavers. The movie seems more earthbound and realistic than its more well-known, glamorous Ross Hunter remake. The stories differ as well. In this version, Colbert is not an aspiring actress, but a saleswoman who enters into business with Beavers, who, though it's her pancake recipe, for some reason is entitled to only 20% of the profits. As a black friend of mine described this story, ""Claudette Colbert steals Louise Beavers' pancake recipe but allows her to live in her home."" Not actually true as the Beavers character refuses to take any money or establish herself in her own home, and Colbert must bank the money for her. Sadly, this seems to be because the Beavers character has accepted her downtrodden role in life.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue by today's standards is truly shocking and, let's face it, politically incorrect as well as downright insulting to Afro-Americans. For this reason, it is an interesting look at life for blacks in those days and makes a disturbing statement. However, the affection the women have for each other, the confidence-swapping friendship, the fact that they do go into business together, and their daughters' friendship speak of things that transcend race and make a wonderful, contrasting statement.<br /><br />There are excellent performances by Ned Sparks and Warren William. William is another interesting artifact of the time, the mustached, elegant leading man in the tradition of John Gilbert that went out of style eventually.<br /><br />In real life, the beautiful black actress, Fredi Washington, who played Peola, refused to ""pass"" and lost out on a huge career, as she was told by producers that, if she passed for white, her star would shine as bright as the biggest stars of the day. Because she did not play white characters, Fredi Washington had to darken her skin with makeup in films so that she could play blacks. Hallie Berry can thank Washington for her career along with Dorothy Dandridge."
"5769_0.txt",91,"The film City of Men is a fantastic Brazilian film. It's directed by the same creator of City of God and the City of Men TV series. Now, personally, I recommend you watch the TV series before watching the movie due to many flashbacks throughout the film. The TV series also adds more depth to the characters that add to the overall enjoyment of the film. The film is still set in the favelas in Rio, but instead of focusing on the gangs as in City of God, it focuses on two 18 year old boys. The film is similar to City of God, but with a more light-hearted feel to it. The film also has similar cinematography. Overall, I prefer City of God to this film, but it is a worthy follow up to a fantastic film. 9 stars out of 10 in relation to City of God, but as a film in general, compared to the majority of films created this would deserve 10 stars."

Thank god you also just listen to it, without this awful film!"
"8460_0.txt",93,"I try to make it a point to watch this movie at least once a year, or when I feel myself getting too cynical. This is because if you are looking for fun movie that really does pull at the kid inside you, then this is definitely it.<br /><br />Robin Williams is just the right kind of goofy for my tastes, and makes an excellent Pan. Captain Hook was perfectly fit by Dustin Hoffman. I could have done without Julia Roberts as Tink. Actually, I can do without Julia Roberts all together. But Bob Hoskins made a great Smee. (I like to watch this and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, back-to-back) Anyways, I watch this movie once a year because the message of the movie, and the reason people watch it, warrants that. A movie where the message is to never lose sight of your inner child. Imagination. Belief in magical creatures. Sword fighting with pirates. All of these things that I'm sure you did as a child, as I did.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, all of the people who have written bad reviews for this movie, saying things like ""The characters weren't believable"", and ""Spielberg tried to answer a question that didn't need an answer"" have lost sight of the kid in themselves, have become pirates, and should have their hands fed to crocodiles. It's a movie. A family movie. One that needs to appeal to both children and adults, which is a difficult task, to be successful. And I believe that this movie succeeds at that very well."
"28564_0.txt",94,"I don't usually like war films, but I've really got to hand it to Enzo G. Castellari for this one; what we have is a true balls to the wall, gritty and violent exploitation masterpiece from the time when a bastard was called a bastard (and not a 'basterd'). The film works principally because rather than focusing on the war itself, it focuses on a group of people thrown into the war; and their personal experiences, which principally consist of blowing German heads off German shoulders. The film begins with a convoy taking a group of American soldiers off to prison for their various crimes against the army. En route to the prison, they are attacked by the Germans; and a group of five men manages to escape. They plan to head for Switzerland; the only neutral land around. However, on their way there; they are again attacked by Germans and forced to find their way on foot through the woods. The film then follows the group as they negotiate their way to Switzerland, and end up becoming involved with a plan to steal a valuable weapon from a German train.<br /><br />The main reason this film works so well is simply down to the fact that it's such a blast! The film is entertaining from the first minute to the very end; and this is achieved by a bunch of interesting characters, some well worked humour; and best of all, a plethora of violence. I'd really love to know what the body count for this movie is as it must be astronomical! The film is Italian; but really you'd never guess unless you're familiar with Enzo G. Castellari's work (which includes crime films and Jaws rip-offs) as the main cast are all American and the film was shot in English. The film is often said to be a rip off of The Dirty Dozen (and indeed, the tagline nods to this) although having (unbelievably) not seen The Dirty Dozen myself, I can't really comment on that. The plot flows very well throughout and there's always plenty going on to keep the interest high. It's a surprisingly high quality film too; very well made and the special effects are good. Overall, this is an absolutely great war movie Quentin Tarantino is going to have to work hard if his ""reimaging"" is going to top it!"
"36815_0.txt",95,"First off, let me state that the person behind this script knows very little about the Jack The Ripper killings. I have bad news for people out there, Sir William Gull was NOT Jack The Ripper. I am not saying I know who is, many theories abound, but the 'Queen Victoria sending her personal physician out to kill the prostitutes that gave her son VD' is one of the more laughable. <br /><br />Secondly, Johnny Depp simply could not emit a convincing British accent. Don't get me wrong, he is a damn good actor, but he was in way over his head with this one.<br /><br />If you need to see a good Jack The Ripper movie, I would recommend Hitchcocks' ""The Lodger"""

Well written, directed and acted, progress keeps things moving (even flying through the air on a wire!) at a good pace that won't leave you behind, but will get you to the end. There are even street scenes with costumes and vehicles galore! In other words, the sets are good as well! Enjoyable!"
"23349_0.txt",97,"I decided to watch this movie on a whim with absolutely no expectations and I was completely charmed by it. Sure, the plot is your usual 30's rom com hogwash where a bad girl meets a good boy, but the script is unusually well-written for a B-picture and provides many laughs and cute romantic moments you'll sigh over. The 2 leads, Dixie Lee and Joe Morrison look unbelievably cute together, though Joe is a bit of a wooden actor. His main purpose in this movie is just to stand around looking cute and sing love songs, which he does remarkably well, so we can forgive him that. Dixie Lee, Bing Crosby's unfortunate first wife, does very well here as she cracks wise and sings. What makes this B movie extra-special are Burns and Allen as supporting characters, and all their gags are not to be missed. Another thing that makes this movie oh so lovable are the marvelous 30's tunes. My favorites were Dixie Lee's solo ""You Got Me Doin' Things"" and Joe's midnight lullaby to Dixie, ""Let Me Sing You to Sleep"". Joe also gives a very lovely rendition of the Tchaikovsky's ""Nur Wer Die Sehnsucht Kennt"".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie suffers when it takes a melodramatic turn in the last 10 minutes but the ending is happy (it's a comedy after all!) and Burns and Allen save the ending somewhat with their antics. Despite all the film's small faults, it's terribly charming, and if you like 30's comedies or musicals I highly recommend it. It'll leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside."
"14900_0.txt",98,"(possible spoilers) If you haven't done so already, IGNORE the critics - GO SEE THIS<br /><br />MOVIE! Beyond Borders is definitely worth seeing. Yes, it is a love story which develops over the course of a dozen years. However, amidst that story, stark and ongoing brutal realities experienced by so many in the world are depicted - and therein lies the importance of this film. It is thought provoking on many levels. On a performance level, the supporting cast filled their roles well. I couldn't help but be drawn into liking particular characters and was especially attentive to a young man's story of his ""dance"" with a landmine. How haunting. Both Jolie (Sara Jordan, English socialite) and Clive Owen( Dr. Nick Callahan) come through with strong performances. I give credit to director Martin Campbell for respecting the dignity of refugees and using generated images as appropriate, rather than exploiting people unnecessarily . This wasn't meant to be a documentary. Although a few situations might have been developed more realistically (hence 8/10 stars), the movie flowed and kept my full attention despite it's two hour plus length. I found the ending both unexpected and powerful. The imagery of Beyond Borders, both visual and verbal , gives pause for thought : Like Sarah Jordan, aid-relief workers most likely have those in their personal lives who say ""don't go, it's not safe there,"" yet they remain motivated to go anyway. Who are the Dr. Callahans who travel to yet another location once their camp is shutdown - perhaps because of reparation or funding cuts? Why the cuts and what is the full impact? Could more be done? How many workers are injured/killed in the field and how do those situations really come about? Or I know of no place in this country where I might walk and be in danger of stepping on a landmine.... but as I sit in a theater eating popcorn, there is a strong possibility someone, somewhere, did and that happens too often. Maybe the price of that ticket and popcorn once a month could start helping UNHCR or HALO or someone... Yes, entertaining films have their place, but others like Beyond Borders carry the hope of lasting impact. Kudos to all those involved in putting this film together."

Although the film tries to explain the concept of lonely woman in search of true love the story, dialogs, music & the director has made it unable to watch. The story line is thin, not at all gripping, the dialogs are just filler & the music is just too bad to listen. Some scenes are filled just to kill time & are not worth watching.

"49803_0.txt",100,"First of all, I have no allegiance to (nor do I have anything against) Michael Moore. This review is as unbiased as can be. I appreciate his films that I have seen, but I rented Manufacturing Dissent with the intention of seeing a thorough counterargument from the other side. What I got was nothing short of childish.<br /><br />There is not a single logical argument presented in this entire film. An argument goes like this:<br /><br />1) If p, then q. 2) p. 3) Therefore, q.<br /><br />This never happens in this film. The entire film is based upon naive associations and assumptions which anyone over the age of 10 should know not to make. For example: Moore is anti-George Bush, therefore Moore is bad! (This is actually suggested in the film. I am not making this up.) To even take this argument *seriously* (much less accept it), you'd have to actually support George Bush. And unless you entirely support George Bush, then you have absolutely no reason to be offended by such an association to Michael Moore! If this sounds ridiculously obvious, that's because it is. And that's how stupid this film is. <br /><br />Another example: Michael Moore is a bad musician, he's fat and ugly, and here's a creepy picture of him with creepy music playing! (Once again, all of these are actually presented in the film.) This, of course, should be an insult to every human's intelligence on the earth. This is just sad. This is nothing less than an 8-year-old attempt at brainwashing/behavioral conditioning. <br /><br />The day after watching this film, I woke up wondering if it was real. At this moment I am looking at a rented copy of Manufacturing Dissent from Blockbuster on my desk...so unfortunately, it is real. And it is possibly the worst documentary of all time."
"39627_0.txt",101,"Despite the full Hollywood treatment (the best sets, color cinematography and actors available), this movie was amazingly ordinary AT BEST. Much of it might be the extreme silliness of the plot and terrible miscasting of Coleman and ESPECIALLY Dietrich as Arabs! If you want to see BETTER similar films of the era, try Kim (with Dean Stockwell and Errol Flynn) or the superlative Thief of Bagdad (with Sabu). Both these movies are MUCH better written and succeed in sweeping the viewer away to a magical world of adventure, while Kismet just seems pretty but dopey--in fact, REALLY dopey. If you don't believe me, look at the pictures of Dietrich and her ridiculous hair styles in the IMDb gallery. <br /><br />This is one of the few Ronald Coleman films I dislike (the other being the VERY dull Story of Mankind)."

We were taking a lunch break and I had decided to sit at the piano and hit some piano keys, just for fun.

Which in my opinion was very surprising. Both people acted very superficial and professional. <br /><br />I was astounded at the storyline, the whole plot kept me captivated because I had absolutely NO idea what was going on, the characters were special in one way or another, you got to understand them well and sympathize if they got hurt or died. <br /><br />Some even gave me the creeps, the guy with the sore lip especially confused me, when I saw him do the whole act around the tree part I was thinking ""oh no, he's going to end up an alien, just like that movie where the woman loses her son and everything's a mystery and suddenly there's people jumping through ceilings."" But I soon realized it was nothing like that, and it had a much more appealing twist to it. <br /><br />One thing that worried me was there was barely no communication with the group of campers, but in the end it didn't bother me because just their actions, the close-up's of the girls faces, the expressions, it was incredibly masterful and artistic. It was like a new kind of interaction.<br /><br />I loved this movie, the odd feeling of confusion it gave me at the end, that almost uncomfortable sensation, it's wonderful when a film makes you feel so much.<br /><br />Whoever compared this to the Blair witch project must have been on crack, and I am bewildered to the fact it has such a low rating.

"44214_0.txt",107,"I have been trying to find this movie for over the last 20yrs. Back in 1985, I saw the trailer for it on T.V. and it started out with an ice cream truck driving down the street. Some kids and adults gathered around the truck while the announcers stated that ""The Stuff"" was here. It's creamy, yummy and you can't get enough of it. Then it showed a man who had eaten about half his ice cream cone and the announcer changed his tone and said, ""It will take you over, eat you and kill you."" and the camera zooms up on the guys mouth, and you can see the creamy white ""Stuff"" eating away the inside of his mouth. Bleah!! It was pretty gross and freaked me out back then. Something like this would have 4-10yrs old running from their T.V. sets. Talk about setting up kids for nightmares.<br /><br />I tried googling ""parasite eating ice cream"" to no avail, until one day on IMDb, I was looking up info on an old ""Snuff"" film from the 70's and saw ""The Stuff"" come up. Immediately, I knew this was the film. So I ran to the video store and was able to rent it.<br /><br />Not only was this movie, not scary, but the acting and the comedic nature were even worse. To make a long story short, here is the premise. Two guys working at a petroleum factory stumble across a pool of white creamy stuff in the ground. One of the guys sticks his finger in it and tastes it. Now I don't know about you, buy any normal person would never taste anything coming out of the ground unless it was water from a Spring pool. Anyway, the guy who tastes it says it taste real good. So good in fact, that they decide to market it as a new kind of ice cream treat, even though it's ""not"" ice cream. Before you know it, it's the best thing since the hot dog and everyone is eaten the stuff in gallons. People who try it, can't stop eating it. This causes other tasty treats on the market to lose profits. Several snack food manufacturers come together and hire an investigator to find out where and how this ""Stuff"" is made. In comes David 'Mo' Rutherford, the private detective who will investigate this tasty treat's mystery. He soon finds out that ""The Stuff"" is causing people to become uncontrollable zombies. The Stuff takes over their bodies and when it's done using them, it eats their insides and leaves through their mouths. It's alive. He also eventually finds out where this stuff is being stored.<br /><br />The special effects of this ""stuff"" is average at best. The movie ""The Blob"" (Steve McQueen) did a better job and that came out many years before this. The acting is pretty back. Only Michael Moriarty seems to be enjoying himself. Paul Sorvino and Danny Aiello are completely wasted in this film. Garrett Morris makes a short appearance, but he was actually better in ""Car Wash"" then in this campy horror flick. Actually, his scene is the only scary part in the film. You'll see.<br /><br />The whole movie is pretty far fetched and if this ""stuff"" was at retailers everywhere, wouldn't there be other investigators and even FBI agents investigating this problem? I think Larry Cohen was basically trying to send a message to consumers who constantly eat and drink the same bad foods day after day (Starbucks coffee, donuts, burgers, french fries and of course ice cream). He's saying don't eat this crap as it can eventually kill you, just like ""The Stuff"". We get it, but it still doesn't make the movie any better.<br /><br />I also think some of the scenes were removed from the film as well. Besides the ice cream truck scene in the trailer, I thought the poster scene with Jason's family in the kitchen on the floor being eaten by the Stuff was in the movie as well. It didn't show up on the DVD, so either it was cut or it never existed and I'm imagining things. A sequel to this movie could be interested if done right. The story of how the ""stuff"" is discovered would need to be changed of course, but an adequate sequel could be accomplished. Similar to how ""The Blobl"" was remade.<br /><br />This movie is not really worth a look. If you must see it, just rent it. It's not even a horror cult classic like The Cube, Phantasm, The Howling or Donnie Darko. I gave it a 4/10 and that was probably being generous. If you're going to made a comical horror film, watch Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 and take lots of notes. ""The Stuff"" isn't funny or scary. It's mostly a waste of time."

I really got the feeling that I got to know them better, even though their lives are sometimes completely different from mine. But most important is the way everything is shot. For those who aren't familiar with the rules made up by Dogma yet, I'll give a small explanation: the director promises not to use extra light, special effects, extra sound effects... They want to make the story speak for itself and show everything in a natural and realistic way. To some this may seem like the most boring concept ever. I guess many people who like movies like The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Spiderman,... movies that are full of special effects, huge scenes and nice visual effects, may not be blown away by this movie. I know that many people may hate the concept, that many people don't want to see this kind of movies, but personally I find this a very welcome concept in a world where everybody seems to feel the need to copy what works, without being original.<br /><br />Kresten has moved from a small Danish island, where his parents farm is, to Copenhagen in order to pursue an excellent career and unconcerned life. He marries his boss's daughter and is sure that he'll become the new boss as soon as his father-in-law decides to retire. But on his honeymoon he gets a phone call that his father died and that he'll have to return home. The only problem is that he has never told his wife that he had a father and a retarded brother, living together on the family farm. Once he arrives at the farm, he sees that much hasn't changed or been done since he left and he decides that they will need a housekeeper to clean up the mess. He sends an advertisement to a local newspaper and he immediately gets a reaction from Liva Psilander. Liva is a prostitute who wants to start a new life. She wants to escape from an anonymous psychopath who harasses her by phone and needs a lot of money to pay her brother Bjarke's school tuition. When Kresten's wife discovers the truth, or at least what she thinks the truth is, she breaks off the marriage and makes sure that Kresten will lose his job at her father's company and that he'll never get it back. Now Kresten will have to live together with his brother, with Livia and her little brother in the old farm on the island...<br /><br />I can assure you that you'll have to get used to the way of filming at first. Perhaps you'll need two viewings to fully appreciate this movie, but once you can see past the style of filming, you'll see that this movie has a very beautiful and hearth warming subject. Personally I really liked it and that's why I give this movie at least an 8/10, even an 8.5/10."
"3724_0.txt",111,"I like this movie and while it lacks the realistic and detailed gore of modern war films, and it does have its glitches and goofs, it did not do a bad job for a 1959 production.The attention to detail given to King Company's organizational structure, and many other technical aspects of the platoon and company level combat operation portrayed was outstanding thanks to Captain Joseph G. Clemons Jr., the movies' technical director and actual commander of King Company during the battle. In addition, there was also an in your face, down in the dirt grittiness about the film that many other war films even to this day lack. One of my favorite parts of this movie was the on going confrontation between Lieutenant Clemons and Private Franklin. The way the conflict played out in the movie brought out the motivational traits from Clemons that makes a great leader and the final acceptance of Franklin of his obligation as a soldier and his willingness to share the fate of his brother in arms, what ever it may be; I love Woody Strode. As one living in the real world, I shaped my views of this film not from the anti-war intent of director Milestone, but from a war movie fan, and real life Grunt perspective. While it does have anti-war overtones courtesy of director Milestone and others, Pork Chop Hill was based on an actual Korean War battle, and book of the same title by U.S. Army historian S.L.A. Marshal, and the movie does contain many factual events such as the friendly fire incident at the command post. I like Pork Chop Hill for the Hollywood production that it is, and would recommend that its critics be ignored, and enjoy the movie."
"12423_0.txt",112,"This movie is in a class by itself. It is it by turns funny and frighteningly violent.<br /><br />It reminded me a bit of Gilbert Grape, since it is a about a man who lovingly cares for his retarded younger brother. The retarded brother Rud looks a bit like a troll. He is repulsive at first and gradually he grows on you as you realise he is not dangerous.<br /><br />The pace in very slow, like a Sunday afternoon picnic in the Danish countryside.<br /><br />Counterposed to this is the frantic life of a prostitute trying to get away from her perverted and violent clients, and the way the hookers band together for mutual protection.<br /><br />One of the charming themes is the way Rud wins over the obnoxious younger brother of the prostitute, and in a way tames him.<br /><br />The title Mifune comes from a game the brothers play, with the older one pretending to be a terrifying samurai who lives in the basement.<br /><br />The pace can be maddenly slow, somewhat like the Unbearable Lightness of Being, with nothing much happening, just like real life, then POUNCE some momentous event lands out of the blue."
"36606_0.txt",113,"Caught this tonight on cable and have to say it surprised me - didn't figure out what was really going on, even though I knew that what was being shown wasn't the entire story, and I have seen so many films like this, where what you see isn't exactly what you get, where you can't take anything at face value, so it shouldn't have fooled me. But it did. It's the sort of movie that leaves you shaking your head at the end, wondering why you didn't see it coming (no pun intended). <br /><br />Sheedy, Baldwin and Kensit turn in clever performances, with enough eroticism to keep you watching and wondering where the heck it's actually going. I don't know if it would be as enjoyable in a movie theater, but seeing it at home from the perspective of my couch was a decent experience."
"46690_0.txt",114,"Oh dear. I watched this film because a colleague recommended it. I will have serious words with her next time I see her. Here's why...<br /><br />A good film can be let down by a moment in the film when you, the viewer, don't believe (or buy) the characters' decisions or actions. This happened in The Wrestler, when the main character 'forgot' to attend the dinner date that he had managed to arrange with his estranged daughter. However, I would say on balance that The Wrestler is a good film, as other aspects of the film compensated for this 'moment'.<br /><br />Right At Your Door, on the other hand is literally riddled with moments which made me question the characters' actions and decisions to the point that I was saying out loud, phrases beginning with ""Why did he just...?"" or ""Why doesn't she...?"" This kind of spoilt the viewing experience for me.<br /><br />Also, I can't say that on balance, in spite of these numerous confusing/irritating moments, that RAYD is a good film. As many have said, the idea is good, but the script is really weak. The 'twist' at the end of the film left me furious. I really did feel like I had wasted 90 minutes of my life. I wanted all the characters to die of the poison - along with anyone who had anything to do with the relaxation of this cinematic sludge.<br /><br />And yet, there are people and critics who rate this film quite highly. Perhaps you should see it for yourself, but by no means do that under my recommendation."
"26528_0.txt",115,"In a grim totalitarian near future married couples are allowed to have only one kid. John Brennick (a solid and engaging performance by Christopher Lambert) and his pregnant wife Karen (well played by the fetching Loryn Locklin) get arrested for trying to have a second child. They are both sent to a brutal subterranean maximum security penitentiary run by the cruel Prison Doctor Poe (a splendidly wicked Kurtwood Smith). Of course, John plans to escape and take Karen with him. Director Stuart Gordon relates the absorbing story at a brisk pace, does an expert job of maintaining a tough, gritty tone throughout, and stages the thrilling action scenes with rip-roaring verve (the climactic jailbreak sequence in particular is quite tense and stirring). The uniformly ace acting from a tip-top cast qualifies as another significant asset: Lambert and Locklin make for sympathetic leads, Smith excels in one of his customary bad guy roles, plus there are stellar supporting performances by Jeffrey Combs as flaky, bespectacled computer whiz D-Day, Lincoln Kilpatrick as wise trustee inmate Abraham, Tom Towles as mean roughhouse bully Stiggs, Vernon Wells as vicious top con Maddox, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as scrappy young punk Nino Gomez. David Eggby's fluid, polished cinematography, the nifty special effects, Frederic Talgorn's moody, rousing score, and a few dollops of grisly gore are all on the money effective and impressive. A very cool and satisfying science fiction film."
"5994_0.txt",116,"This is the first manga film that I watched, and the reason to develop my interest and look for more movies. And thanks to this baby I found ""AKIRA"", for which I won't stop being grateful. The movie, simply said, has it all. there's action, thrill, criticizing general issues, a bit of romance. The big influence comes from Hiro - he's a boy, deeply interested and amazed by all the unfairness in this world, and as we can see, does everything in his powers to fix it all. Even though he is still a teenager, his seriousness and bravery make his a truly amazing character.<br /><br />a perfect movie, worth the time 10 out of 10"

The actors seemed as if they were reading off of a teleprompter, the music was way overdone, they kept using the same crime scene photo over and over and over.... Everything was so cliché'. Don't waste your time watching this. You would do better to just read the story on the internet. I wish I had looked at the IMDb rating before I chose this movie. The cover looked very interesting, plus what a story line. But it failed miserably. I have never heard of any of the actors, I now know why. And I can't recall ever hearing of the director before."

"14610_0.txt",121,"I liked this movie a lot, in many ways much more that than the original Mimic. In particular, Alix Koromzay is great playing the slightly flaky, completely adorable bug-nut scientist/teacher. She is much more interesting than Mira Sorvino, who wasn't bad in the first movie. The story here is simpler, not a bad thing in a horror flick, as the plot stays on a straight course with good effect. For those looking for big-time special effects, Mimic 2 might not satisfy. But for some good campy fun and scares, check this one out."

Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likable hero and Oldman a hissable villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch.<br /><br />But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson is VERY bad as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to 'SHUT UP!'

"17467_0.txt",124,"Ichi-1 is the prequel to Ichi The Killer. It's not the best movie in the world, but it's a lot better than I thought it would be. It's about Ichi in high school. He gets bullied and that's when he starts to go nuts. It's got some great fight scenes too. It's also of course got a few nasty scenes. The baseball scene was pretty disturbing. The main problem I had with this movie though was the fact that there were no teachers at the school. I can't believe not one teacher stopped any fights at school all those kids had. I didn't see one teacher at all at the school period. I guess all the kids scared them off or something. Ichi-1 is a low budget movie, but much better than most low budget movie I've seen. It's also got a bit of comedy in the movie too. The movie is all in Japanese though, so unless you can speak Japanese you'll have to read the English subtitles. It's worth checking out if you liked Ichi The Killer, but it might disappoint some people. I recommend renting it first.<br /><br />I give Ichi-1 a 7/10"

"8226_0.txt",126,"Lake Mungo follows the familiar mockumentary style that has become the stable of many a modern day horror film. The film is painfully slow with some incredibly bad performance by the cast who seemed to working with dialogue and without any genuine emotion to their grief. Lake Mungo feels like someone watched Twin Peaks a few too many times then stumbled across The Last Broadcast and decided they want a J Horror moment as the cliff hanger moment. Clever ideas that were poorly executed. The film has way too many unrealistic ideas for a so called realistic ghost story. The film felt like it had it's running time padded out with plenty of shots of the sky and the Australian bush backed with atmospheric music. The bushland could have become key element in this story but instead it's relegated to running time material. Lake Mungo is all about the atmosphere and the potential for things to happen which never materialise in this film. This is one of the rare occasions that the idea of Hollywood remaking this film is actually interesting because hopefully the new writers will expand on the good concept and deliver whole lot more action, horror and drama."
"28076_0.txt",127,"I guess one of the reasons I liked this film so much was because my expectations were so incredibly low. After all, this film was made by a ""Poverty Row"" studio I'd never heard of and the movie has slipped into the public domain. Plus, while I like the star, Lionel Atwill, he had a habit of making films for crap studios. Fortunately, I was wrong and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie...even if the plot is a tiny bit tough to believe.<br /><br />The film starts off with Atwill playing a tycoon who owns a very successful steel mill. He's an interesting boss, as he often goes to work with the men in the mill! I thought this was an interesting idea but it didn't work all that well for one major reason--Atwill's erudite presence just made it very, very hard to believe him working in a steel mill! But, despite this, the plot became very interesting very quickly. It seems that a corporation wanted to buy up his mill but Atwill had no interest in selling. So, to force the sale, the leader of some horrible schemers did some outrageously evil things. First, he instigated an accident in the mill where Atwill was almost killed. In fact, his legs were burned off by molten steel deliberately poured on him!! He spent the next several months in the hospital--during which time, the evil plan grew. First, they convinced him to give his power of attorney to his ""loving wife""--who then sold the mill! Then, she ran off to Europe with all the funds--leaving Atwill poor and without the business! Later, however, Atwill is able to recreate his fortune in a very unique way--he forms a union, of sorts, with the handicapped beggars on the street (much more common in the 1930s than today, thank God). He helped them find gainful employment, invested their earnings, got them health and retirement plans--and made a wonderful life for these marginally employable men. Why he did this was partly because he was a nice person and part of this was so that he could rebuild his fortune and regain his old factory. The plan would take many, many years and there were some nice twists along the way, but by the end of the film, he has his confrontation with his arch-enemy--the man who did so much to orchestrate his ruin.<br /><br />Overall, the film has a truly unique plot that kept me guessing. While you'd think it would simply be a tale of betrayal and revenge, it was so much more. It also is one of the better early depictions of the handicapped as having so much more to offer society and themselves. And, to top it all off, the acting was very good--especially Atwill and his friend, played by Henry Walthall. A nice little hidden gem.<br /><br />By the way, a 9 seems like a high score, but I am comparing it to other B-films. Compared to the rest, this is definitely a standout--one that got me thinking well after the film ended."
"36641_0.txt",128,"Oddly enough, this was the first Pink Panther film I ever saw. Thanks to its ""flashback"" scenes, I got interested in the PP series and eventually saw all the previous entries.<br /><br />Although this film was clearly a bad idea from the beginning, the first half actually isn't too bad. I didn't realize, until it was pointed out, that all of Sellers' scenes were deleted (or reused) footage from previous films. I had thought (like some other people who've commented) that Sellers had actually filmed scenes for this movie but died before finishing; that's testimony that Edwards actually did a pretty good job of incorporating old footage into a new story.<br /><br />Things start to go wrong when the Sellers footage runs out, at the moment Closeau's voice is dubbed in with the worst imitation imaginable. Soon almost all pretense of a plot is dropped. Now we get pointless interviews with past PP characters that comprise a tribute (often unbearably corny) to Closeau. He's discussed as if he's a movie character but the interviewees aren't; it all has nothing to do with how anyone would act if Closeau were real or any of the ""plot"" were actually happening. ""Flashback"" scenes are over-explained, and one in particular (involving Cato) comes so totally out of nowhere as to be confusing and disruptive. Finally, the scene with the ""grape treaders"" was totally unnecessary. (At least it was easily edited out for TV showings.)<br /><br />Not everything's bad, though. Herbert Lom is the best thing about this movie; he holds it together as well as could be expected. Showing scenes from Closeau's early life was a good idea, even if it wasn't carried out well. The part with the dog guiding the old woman is original and funny. At the end plot points are left unresolved all over the place, but that's OK because we're being set up for a sequel.<br /><br />One could say this movie shouldn't have been made. That's arguable, but it certainly could have been made better than it was."

It is in fact a movie which would have been called a Video Nasty at one time and caters to the demand for Extreme Horror.And since the 70s Horror is in demand more than ever especially the kind about mad doctors who get struck off the register for conducting live autopsies! The only thing missing was David Parker Ray-I mean this wasn't fiction it really happens every other month -try reading Sadistic Killers. It delivers just what it says on the box-but you need to have some experience before you delve into it. Wide open for a sequel but somehow I couldn't see 1000 corpses.The title would have been better to just Corpses its something of a mouthful and sounds like one of those 50s horror flicks of the Night of the Flesh Eating Zombies type.

They looked like limited-animation cutouts. The poor effects throughout the film spoiled any experience of it.<br /><br />Aerial shots were obviously filmed in front of a green screen. The balloon moved unrealistically against a backdrop of sky.<br /><br />Time scale is wrong. How did these guys travel from the Eastern US to the Pacific in one night?

"48123_0.txt",132,"Make no bones about this - this film is an utter disgrace and an alarmingly bad piece of cinema. I've reviewed several exploitation flicks (most of which were all produced on 'shoe-string' budgets) and have found that most, if not all, of them have some form of redeeming feature. 'The Dead Next Door' is completely devoid of anything seriously positive, though. Its self awareness of Romero's zombie movies makes it even more heinous - characters with names such as 'Raimi', 'Savini' et al. This film stands out more as a landmark of crass, mundane, tedious, z-rate, and student filming more than anything credible. The only vaguely rousing element of the film is that it does feature shed-loads of (seemingly harmless) zombies and no particular lack of gore. However, to watch this film as a parody doesn't even work.<br /><br />For anyone who may be curious as to acquiring a copy of this - simply give it a miss - it is absolute garbage. Riddled with truly atrocious acting, dire plot, terrible sound (it would seem that the dubbing was inserted with a crow-bar!), laughable gore and special effects.

The length of the film is excessive. In the end you care about no one involved and you are left feeling the conclusion (though there really is none) is totally unsatisfactory.<br /><br />The violence contained in the film is never shown though the effects of the violence and its remnants are displayed prominently.<br /><br />My belief is that the director was trying to show how passé we now find violence and even goes an extra step to show bare sexuality (there is no nudity in the movie) against the back drop of the violence to allow the audience to judge their own ""arousal factors"" and how close they are to violence.<br /><br />But no matter what the directors intention, the product was without merit. I would recommend not watching the film. Not even when suffering from extreme sleeplessness in hopes that this might lull you into a restful slumber - trust me it won't.<br /><br />Tim Roth is wasted with very little dialog. Naomi Watts is wasted though she is able to show a great deal of emotion and is used for her looks as an arousal tool.

All I will say is that it's probably not for the younger crowd. In all honesty, if I had seen this film in my early twenties (and I'm now almost 40), I wouldn't have appreciated its subtlety on long term relationships. It's aimed at those of us who have been married, or in a long term relationship. Although I don't have children, the rest of this movie had many ""oh yeah"" moments for me. The Story of Us, is a complex, yet ultimately simple, explanation of long term relationships...all those 'little' things about the other person that drive you insane about them, but that if you're both willing to work on, make the relationship all that much richer for it. Wonderfully thought provoking. If you have ever been in a long term adult relationship, I'd be hard pressed to see how you COULDN'T relate, at the very least, on some small level to this film."

And, last but not least, an splendid photography in wonderful Technicolor. I though it was a western and I find instead a strange community making whisky clandestinely at Ozark Mountains Region, Arkansas,who remind me some people I meet in a trip to North of England, near Kyle of Lochals, very reluctant to contact with foreigns. I like the 80% of the film, that was made with conviction, professionalism and care by excellent craftsman Henry Hathaway. It is is a bite too much melodramatic and out of date, but interesting. I give it an seven."
"32839_0.txt",140,"well thats my first review, you can guess!! the movie was actually that bad.....Yes it is one of the worst movie ever it is non horror at all , should be a thriller of a low grade and never be made as horror at all .True that the plot start promising but i just lost all interest after 29 minute of hardly trying to keep my eyes open ....why you ask >>>well thats a Thai movie who tries to capture a phenomena that happen to turn it to supernatural base it is purely cultural which is OK an all but the movie have set Zero effort to place any fear There is suspense I give u that but overall the film could have been made into a much better film and in my own review i say the idea is great but the display is very very poor just give it try when u have time to kill and u are Bored so just by then knock yourself out lol"
"24726_0.txt",141,"A friend of mine is currently attending grad school at Northern Illinois and was fortunate enough to receive passes to a ""test screening"" of this film. Knowing absolutely nothing about the film going in I had low expectations, more or less thinking I was about to sit through a student film. The misgivings continued through the credits when I saw a cast of names that, although recognizable, hardly signal quality in a motion picture. I was pleased to find, however, a true diamond in the rough; a decent tongue-in-cheek thriller that left everyone in the audience entertained throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Basically, Judd's character is a rich hermit who insists on living a self-fulfilling prophesy of going insane, a notion that has been ingrained in him ever since his father flipped out and slaughtered his mother. Wrapped up in his own personal demons, he invites Vincent Spano along for the ride and asks him to investigate the motives of his trophy wife, Jennifer O'Dell, who he think is an ill-intentioned vamp trying to drive him insane and rob him blind. Drama and confrontation unfolds in a fairly simple fashion, but the result is a solid effort that is both tense and occasionally funny. While I would hardly call the movie a shocker, there are enough unexpected twists to keep you engrossed.<br /><br />Since this was a test screening, the sound was still a little rough and the time code had yet to be removed, both of which proved to be a bit distracting. But all of the performances stood out, particularly Judd Nelson, who makes us completely forget about The Breakfast Club while reminding us that he can still act. Given that director lives in Michigan, the only member of the crew in attendance to talk about the film was the production manager, who acted more like an MC than a member of the crew. He suggested the crew was made up of a bunch of young first-timers, which I don't doubt given some of the experience listed on this page. After hearing that, I became more impressed with the end result and would gladly watch it again once the final product is released. The PM also said they were still searching for a distribution deal, so I would like to wish Mr. Zambeck best of luck in his endeavors and would strongly recommend checking this out once it becomes available."
"45502_0.txt",142,"Could Mel Brooks have seen this before he wrote his screenplay for ""The Producers""? The two films sure have a lot in common. Unfortunately, ""Manhattan Parade"" is a shout-fest -- apparently, the movie director didn't trust the microphones to pick up normal conversations, and when the movie was converted from its live stage form, nobody told the actors to stop playing to the balcony. So much is screamed it becomes tiresome quickly. If only the lines were memorable enough to be screamed.<br /><br />But I liked the moxieness of the wife, the elegant solutions of the research director, and, yeah, the limp-wristed gayness of the artistic director, a walking dictionary of practically every gay cliché there is. All of this stuff became impossible once the Code kicked in, so the movie does have its interests, if perhaps mainly for film and cultural historians."
"12545_0.txt",143,"This move is quite fun. No award winner but really enjoyable. Kids will love this film but I think most adults will too. Sean Hayes as the evil cat was excellent and quite funny. Yes it was a little hokey but hey, I wasn't expecting anything different. Jeffrey Goldblum's performance left a little to be desired but considering the role, it was allright.<br /><br />Overall I was quite pleased with all the animal characters and laughed quite a bit throughout the film. I definitely recommend this film but try to see it on a matinee."
"45241_0.txt",144,"The idea of teaming Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould together in a movie must have seemed like a good idea after their success with MASH. Giving them a half decent script would have probably helped a lot though. Instead we have a half-baked spy spoof with our two heroes stumbling along from one situation to another. About the only decent thing going for this mess of a movie is the fact that it was shot mostly in France. Vladek Sheybal as the head Russian spy is also quite good(he just oozes Eastern European charm). Otherwise, some pretty stupid characters, a few decent explosions and a lot of running around. I hope Sutherland and Gould were well paid for this. Note to producers: If you're going to spoof a genre that is no longer in vogue, at least make it funny."
"38130_0.txt",145,"You'd have to be a fan of farces to like this. It has some novel ideas, such as illegally obtaining a fresh cadaver that has to be transported from the city morgue to the school, while rigor mortis is beginning to set in. Alan Arkin has a secondary, not a starring, role. He brings more to the part than the writer gave him. Steve Guttenberg is surprisingly good as the son of a doctor who can't get into an American medical school, or even a first or second grade foreign one. Curtis Armstrong, in particular, is terrific in his medical student role. Over all, however, this is strictly a B movie. Julie Haggerty is terrible as the glamorous student with whom the school director (Arkin) is enamored. There is nothing alluring about her looks, and her approach to comedy acting is out of sync with the rest of the cast's."
"11160_0.txt",146,"The plot of the film has our heroine shooting a man during a religious crusade. She hasn't been long out of prison and is thrown back on death row. While awaiting her date with destiny a minister arrives and she recounts her life. It is a life of pain and suffering that never quite goes right despite her best intentions.<br /><br />Have you ever watched a film that you thought was extremely well done but which you couldn't not relate to at all? For me this is one of the few films I found that is beyond my scope of experience. The life and pain of this black woman simply did not connect with this white man. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film, I just couldn't connect emotionally with events on the screen.<br /><br />That said this is very good movie. The acting is excellent. The story is compelling, even if I couldn't emotionally connect with it. This is a film to try if you run across it. You may not love it but you'll probably like it.<br /><br />7 out of 10"
"24858_0.txt",147,"ODE TO BILLY JOE is a humerous and touching tale of events leading up to why ""Billy Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"", as related in the Bobbie Gentry hit. Director Max Baer Jr. (who would have thought ""Jethro"" had this kind of talent?) skillfully re-creates an atmosphere of 1950's rural Mississippi. and breathes life into characters only hinted at in the song. Scripted by Herman Raucher, with the same feeling of nostalgia he gave SUMMER OF '42, and beautifully scored by Michel Legrand, ODE TO BILLY JOE is a sweet and touching story of the awkwardness of teenage love, and the consequences of an unfortunate event, which, in today's politically correct times, would probably be scorned or laughed at. Glynnis O'Connor and Robby Benson, are re-teamed after their excellent debut in JEREMY. Another treasured film on VHS, that I hope will someday come out on DVD."
"41890_0.txt",148,"Is this movie some kind of joke? It looks like the camera crew went to best buy and bought a hand-held Sony camcorder to record the whole darn thing! The acting in this movie makes bad soap opera actors look ingenious in their work. I had to pay to rent this?? This movie should be in the FREE box, so then I could take it just to burn it. One guy posted a review that mentioned ""I've had turds that were more interesting than this movie"", and I think I would agree with that.<br /><br />When I picked up this movie at the video store it looked decent at first; at the bottom it showed 4 awards from 4 different festivals that looked like this<br /><br />WINNER, Newy York Independent Film Festival, WINNER Detroit International Horror Film Festival, WINNER, Fantastic Festival of Film UK, WINNER, Barebones International Film Festival<br /><br />WHAT??? maybe if I make my own low budget film, put absolutely NO effort into it, these film festivals will love my movie as well as this piece of crap."

Most of the comments here echo my own thoughts, wonderful performances and a solid if somewhat clichéd script -- but it works its charm on you! I love the mayor's line, ""I couldn't be happier if I were twins."" Lastly, it occurred to me that it's like an American version of a great Bill Forsyth movie, Local Hero! Rent that one and see the parallels."
"25812_0.txt",150,"This film has been on my wish list for years and years. I'd heard so many people commenting that it was one of the best paranoid movies ever. Now, I love suspenseful thrillers and there has been some amazing movies based on an apocalyptic scenario; The Day After, Dawn of the Dead, 12 Monkeys, 28 Days Later, Planet of the Apes, Terminator etal, so was really looking forward to this movie. The synopsis to Miracle Mile sounded really cool, angsty and believable, but what I found myself watching was probably one of the most unbelievably annoying, cheesy, badly acted, badly directed, and badly edited movies I've seen in a long time. In a nutshell it was awful, made worse by the fact that it could have been quite brilliant. As I said the story had the potential to be something special, but the clumsy screenplay and shoddy direction nuked that idea right out the window. It was also oddly camp as hell, quite an achievement for a film depicting the end of the world. Fair enough the 80's trappings didn't help, but what was unforgivable was the performances by EVERYONE involved. What the hell was everyone on? Did they all assume they were shooting the worst film of their careers and therefore were too embarrassed to deliver anything remotely like a competent performance? Every part of this film sucked, right through to the retarded ending with the bloody daft helicopter, complete with a HUGE gay lycra cald pilot (bizarrely played by the hulking Brian Thompson of X-files fame). The only, thing that made it almost worthwhile was seeing this rubbish nuked off the screen at the end. So to surmise, if you want to watch a nuclear thriller with unintentional laughs which is camper than a row of Rocky Horror Show fans then I'd point you to Wargames, because I simply can't recommend Miracle Mile to anybody. Not even the director of this crap, who by rights should be forced to watch this movie again, and again until he publicly denounces his film as the worst since Howard the Duck. Hang on a minute, maybe those two crapfests would make a suitably horrid double bill in purgatory."
"38463_0.txt",151,"<br /><br />There is nothing really to recommend ""Peaches"". You could see the ending coming from the beginning (esp. with the preview ads). The audience only laughed on spotted occassions, and often the laughter was patched even then. The male protaganists seemed to be one dimensional mostly with the only character development being based around relationship attitudes.<br /><br />A big problem I felt however was the lack of any real direction in the movie. There was no structure to it and it seemed to drift aimlessly. Sure there's nothing wrong with experimenting with the narrative design but theres no point if it doesn't amount to anything.<br /><br />So what do we end up with? A snapshot of the lives of three guys just leaving college and finding out how to live life properly? You can see it on a variety of tv programs done to a superior degree. Peaches are not the only fruit...thankfully we've more variety."

We saved it and watched it late at night, mainly yelling back at the television.<br /><br />The odd thing was that the first half hour was actually pretty good. There was some good suspense as the lead character and Shapeshifter gets introduced, but then the film got bogged down. <br /><br />All the kills were pretty obvious and the gore was less realistic and more exaggerated, almost as if the filmmakers were just having fun with it. I'm not sure the style would be very satisfying to hard core horror fans.<br /><br />The best part was actually the beast, the old ""man in a rubber suit,"" more more fun and way more campy than a computer made monster.

"5465_0.txt",155,"To tell the truth, I nearly did not bother with this one; to tell the truth it's all the same anyway; I gave up on Perdita Durango, haven´t bothered much with other titles by this very singular Basque director, but have at last sat through an entire film.<br /><br />Using satire to the nth degree, even going to the extremes of including a take-off of `the Exorcist', `El Día de La Bestía' is a mixture of horror, comedy and spoof, and most definitely a cock in the snout at anyone remotely religious. Rolling along at an intrepid pace, the film is an insight into what a feverish mind and overheated imagination can cook up. I mean, the story is impossible, but that is the magic of cinema...........isn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, everyone is rather round the bend, off his rocker or stark, staring bonkers as we British youngsters used to say near half a century ago. Whilst unravelling Amharic scrawls the Right Reverend Father Ángel Beriartúa discovers that the antichrist will be born on Christmas Day in Madrid. From there to a blood-letting search of the most bizarre in which all kinds of weird goings-on are coming off, normally at hell-bent speed, which is probably where everyone should end up anyway, the film is a debauch into trivial skylarks, heavily dosed up with all the gruesome products of horror and perversity liberally mixed into a comical cocktail of doubtful parentage.<br /><br />What I cannot fathom is how they managed to get Maria Grazia Cucinotta to fall down those stairs so spectacularly, without any parts of her anatomy plopping out of that dress...............<br /><br />If you like this kind of nonsensical black humour, I suggest you give `Airbag' (1997) (qv) by the also Basque director Juanma Bajo Ulloa a try."
"26529_0.txt",156,"Getting sent to prison for having a second baby even though the first one died? That's really unfair, but what a good idea for our prisons we have now. Not with that evil warden who kills people, but activating pain to prisoners who break the rules. That would be great. When seeing this film the first time, it makes me wonder why they don't allow prisoners to dream good things about intimacy, yet they allow assault by that 187 guy. It wasn't good how John was mind-wiped for not killing a man, because if he had done that, Prison Director Poe would of used that to keep him in prison for later on. So what's being pointed out in this movie is that murder is not allowed in the public, but in prison, the warden is allowed to murder whoever he wants and if a prison doesn't obey his orders to murder someone, they get punished, and they may of been in there in the first place for murder. That really doesn't make sense. Still a great film though!"

I watched the subtitled version (which I always feel is best) and was really taken aback by the great little film. This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit. There are scenes of great emotion as the film works it's way to a hugely emotive ending. Superb. One to be viewed again and again."
"10477_0.txt",160,"Steve Buscemi has long been one of the premiere character actors in the business; his resume reads like a veritable Who's Who of interesting, complex characters who run the gamut from psycho hit-man to regular guy, all of whom he has brought vividly to life in film after film. And whether or not a particular project is a hit or a flop, Buscemi is always good, and can always be counted upon to add that extra something to any given film, as he has in `Trees Lounge,' an affecting drama he not only stars in, but with which he makes his debut as a writer/director-- and an impressive debut it is.<br /><br />	Tommy Basilio (Buscemi) is an out-of-work mechanic who lives alone above a bar called Trees Lounge in Long Island, N.Y. He's more than a bit down on his luck; not only did he lose his job, but his pregnant girlfriend of eight years, Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) recently dumped him for his former boss, Rob (Anthony LaPaglia). He wants to pick himself up and get his life back together, but he doesn't seem to know where to start, and the garages to which he's applied for work aren't exactly knocking his door down to hire him. So he gravitates to the Trees, where he can at least interact with others who seem to be in situations not entirely unlike his own, though at different stages and for different reasons. But they all have one thing in common-- they're people just trying to get through the day; they're trying to get through life. If they can only figure it all out.<br /><br />	With this film, Buscemi proves that he is more than just a talented actor, but rather a true artist in every sense of the word, with his chosen medium being film. He has an eye for detail which complements his insights into human nature and enables him to effectively translate his material to the screen. His characters are finely drawn and complex, and with each and every one he manages to successfully avoid the stereotypes to which a setting like this could easily lend itself (and no doubt would, in lesser hands). Even with the minor characters, he succinctly gives you enough of who they are that it allows you to see beneath the surface and know what makes them tick. And he does it imaginatively-- by filling a room with photographs or items that reflect who a certain person is, for example, or simply by training his camera on someone's face and allowing that extra beat that affords the viewer a telling glimpse of what's hiding behind a character's eyes. Buscemi has an innate sense of knowing how to convey what he's trying to say, and he does it in a million small and different ways that are subtle and incisive. Simply put, he knows what works-- including how to get what he wants out of his actors-- and he presents it all with a pace and timing that are right on the mark.<br /><br />	In Tommy, Buscemi creates a character to whom many will be able to relate and identify on any number of different levels. To say that Tommy is a `loser' would be too much of a simplification, because the character is too complex for that tag alone to be accurate. Tommy is blue-collar, down on his luck, and like so many people in real life, just can't seem to put it all together, can't figure out how `life' is supposed to work. And that's what Buscemi conveys so subtly and so well, and it's the key to the success of this character-- it's what makes Tommy believable and real. Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own. Certainly, he has a wonderful supporting cast that gives him plenty of help, but few character actors have ever been able to step into a lead role with such facility and achieve the level of success Buscemi has here. And it's work that deserves to be acknowledged.<br /><br />	There are a number of notable supporting performances in this film, as well, beginning with Mark Boone Junior, who as Mike captures the essence of a guy who is successful, but a loser nonetheless; LaPaglia, who gives a solid performance as Rob; Bracco, with a performance that is introspectively revealing; Debi Mazar, who with very little screen time leaves an indelible impression (and her eyes are absolutely mesmerizing); Kevin Corrigan (another of the finest character actors around), as Matthew; and especially Chloe Sevigny, as Debbie, Theresa's mature-beyond-her-years, seventeen-year-old niece. <br /><br />	Rounding out the ensemble cast are Carol Kane (Connie), Bronson Dudley (Bill), Michael Buscemi (Steve's real life brother, playing Tommy's brother, Raymond), Suzanne Shepherd (Jackie), Rockets Redglare (Stan), Seymour Cassel (Uncle Al), Annette Arnold (Sandy), Michael Imperioli (George), Mimi Rogers (Patty), Daniel Baldwin (Jerry) and Charles Newmark (Puck). An involving story presented with a rich assortment of memorable, convincing characters, `Trees Lounge' is a drama about life-- about the things going on in your own neighborhood, or downtown or two streets over, no matter where you are in the world. Wherever people are, there are situations like the ones depicted in this film, problems that have to be solved and life that has to be lived. And that's what makes this film so good; it gives the audience a chance to connect with, or at least examine, things that anyone anywhere will be able to recognize. It may have taken a collaborative effort to make this one what it is, but in the end, it's Buscemi's film from start to finish, and a satisfying little gem of a movie it is. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10."

Well, the first few seconds were so excruciatingly bad, I was seriously hoping it was preview for something else.<br /><br />Alas, no.

"29401_0.txt",165,"For Trekkies one of the worst episodes, but for me this is the campiest of them all; not as much regarding what happens but what is being said. There are Edwoodesque dialogues here that had me in stitches.<br /><br />Listed below are some lines/dialogues from TWS. See if you can figure out where the actual dialogue ends and where invented parts begin... (perhaps not that easy!).<br /><br />1. Sulu: ""The Enterprise must have blown up, Captain!"" Kirk: ""Yeah, well, who cares...?"" <br /><br />2. Helsmwoman: ""Mr. Spock, the planet's gone!"" <br /><br />3. Sulu: ""Captain, the ship simply disappeared! What does that mean??"" Kirk: ""Well, it means we're stranded here."" Sulu: ""But, Captain, aren't you worried about the lives of 400 of your crew??"" Kirk: ""I already told you: I ain't. This is Season 3, and I'm a little more apathetic about things."" <br /><br />4. Helmswoman: ""What bothers me is the stars, Mr.Spock... they're all wrong."" Spock: ""There's something wrong with your head, Missy. The stars are fine just as they are..."" <br /><br />5. McCoy: ""I wonder what killed him..."" Kirk: ""I don't know... But something or someone did."" This is almost the same sort of exchange as in ""Plan 9"": ""I don't know... But one thing's for sure: there's a dead body here, and someone's responsible!"" <br /><br />6. Scotty: ""Mr. Spock, the ship feels wrong."" Spock: ""What do you mean 'feels wrong'?"" Scotty: ""The field is all wrong."" Spock: ""Oh, the FIELD is all wrong. I thought you said 'it feels wrong'."" Scotty: ""I DID say that!"" <br /><br />7. Losira: ""I am... from this planet."" Sulu: ""So the planet IS hollow!"" Losira: ""No, Sulu, the script-writer's head is hollow."" <br /><br />8. Losira: ""I have come for you, Mr.Sulu... I want to touch you."" Sulu: ""Touch Kirk! I'm gay..."" <br /><br />9. Sulu: ""How can such evil BE, Captain?! She's so beautiful..."" Kirk: ""I know... Evil only comes from ugly people."" <br /><br />10. Sulu: ""I'd rather be on the Enterprise."" (Translation: ""Mommy, I wanna go home!!"") Kirk: ""I agree, Sulu... I'd rather rest my head between Uhura's massive pillows now than be fighting aliens on this damn planet."" <br /><br />One of the most amazing, absurd, unique hence entertaining aspects of this wildly funny episode is Spock's atypical grumpiness, which manifests itself at least a dozen times in sarcasm(!) and put-downs(!!) of crew members. The cranky side of Spock, that we didn't even know existed until TWS, really comes into the forefront in this episode. Perhaps male Vulcans have their period every seven years?<br /><br />No-one was safe from Spock's venomous ripostes. Examples:<br /><br />1. When Uhura asks ""what happened?"", after the ship is shaken up, Spock proceeds to literally and in full detail explain the physics of his fall - like some demented robot, and without a trace of sarcasm. (He was still warming up for the upcoming sarcastic remarks.) <br /><br />2. Uhura: ""How did she get off the ship, sir?"" Spock: ""Presumably the same way she got on it."" This was such a cheap shot by Spock, the kind of dumb comment one could expect from a 6th-grader! <br /><br />3. Sick-bay Doctor: ""Your guess is as good as mine, Mr.Spock."" Spock: ""I would suggest you refrain from guessing and focus on the task at hand."" So the TWS Spock can dish out sarcasm, but is too dim too detect it from others, or at least to recognize a common phrase when he hears one.<br /><br />4. Uhura: ""What are the chances the Captain and the others are still alive?"" Spock: ""Lieutenant, we do not engage in gambling."" This, coming from Starfleet's Annual Intergalactic Useless Statistics/Odds Champion! <br /><br />Meriwether, looking vaguely Raquel Welchian, going around killing people in spite of feeling ambivalent about hurting them is a bit amusing, too. (The wishy-washiest killer of them all.) At the end, Kirk and co. even engage in quasi-slapstick, when they keep changing the order of how they stand to avoid being touched by the strange pacifistic-yet-murdering alien woman/robot.<br /><br />Apart from bombarding the viewer with unintentional nonsense every single minute, TWS is also a visually high-quality episode, with great sets and wonderfully bombastic 60s colours. The Losira-gets-folded special effect is very effective."
"30351_0.txt",166,"...that a human mind is capable of creating such intriguing plot - so terrifying and captivating this movie is. Frank Capello is obviously a man of genius. But he is not nice and gentle to his audience. The movie is sharp-straight, honest and pretty cruel to a person watching it. It doesn't compromise. Don't expect it to comply with general drama movie rules. <br /><br />*** BE AWARE OF SPOILERS BELOW ***<br /><br />After you ve seen 50% of it or so you think it's pretty common drama, quite predictable and possibly happily ending one. Well, its not. Not at all. And so shockingly not.<br /><br />Cast is perfect. I would never think Slater could fit into the role of Bob. W.Macy would fit better, I thought. But these thoughts faded away.<br /><br />The movie is not open-ended despite what some people say. You just have to think harder than you usually do while watching a regular movie. Be more attentive or watch it again.<br /><br />Capello makes you think. If you want to know what really happened analyze the details. There are answers.<br /><br />I give 9 out of 10, because Capello rudely and savagely ruined my hopes for the better ending :)"
"10670_0.txt",167,"It's impossible - for me at least - to know whether or not Ann Fontaine was familiar with Joe Orton's sixties play Entertaining Mister Sloane (subsequently filmed)before writing and directing Nettoyage a sec some thirty years later but it is reasonable to assume that the central premise - bi-sexual catalyst male enters and ultimately disrupts household via sexual encounters with both male and female - is very similar with, in the case of the latter, a Gallic twist. Orton's protagonist disrupted a home occupied by a brother and sister both childless whilst Fontaine's shares a home with a married couple who have a child. There are, of course, other substantial differences, where Mr Sloane came, as it were, out of nowhere, Loic (Stanislas Merhar) is first encountered by Nicole (Miou-Miou) and Jean-Marie (Charles Berning) Kunstler in a club where he is performing a cross-dressing act with his sister Marilyn (Mathilde Seigner)and only goes to live with the Kunstlers some time later when Marilyn leaves both him and the act in favour of life with her boy friend. The Kunstlers have been married for some fifteen years and it may be said that the marriage has become as 'dry' as the dry cleaning business they own and is in need of sexual 'cleaning'. If so they came to the right place for the amoral Loic is happy to oblige, first by seducing Nicole - not terribly difficult as she was ripe for seduction - and then, with less success, Jean-Marie. What we have here is a fine, tightly written and directed script acted to perfection by the three principals and arguably the finest of Fontaines early films - Berning would later appear in her How I Killed My Father. Very definitely worth seeing."

Yoddling is a torture technique, oh my, hilarious, my sides are just splitting.<br /><br />Sorry, kids are more sophisticated than this. This is entertaining for no one. Oh, and the animation? Dull.

"48539_0.txt",169,"So here we have an Adam Sandler drama parading around as an Adam Sandler comedy. That's all fair and well right? Well it would be, if Adam Sandler was a dramatic actor.<br /><br />By now, you most likely know what this film is about. If you don't, Adam Sandler, an overworking father, is given a universal remote by a man named Morty (Christopher Walken) who seemingly works in the back of a Bed, Bath, & Beyond. However, this is no normal remote. No, this universal remote can actually control Sandler's universe. This means muting rants given by his wife Donna (a stunning Kate Beckinsale) and fast-forwarding through showers and sex. Soon, though, Sandler discovers that the remote may actually be a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br /><br />Here is the main problem with Click. It was sold as a comedy. Well it isn't funny. And the dramatic element? It isn't very well done. Sandler just doesn't have the chops to pull off an about face half way through the film. He doesn't make the character of Michael sympathetic enough. So when it comes time to sympathize with him, we can't.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me. It seemed that half the audience I saw this with was sobbing through the last half hour. Maybe I'm too critical. Or, on the other hand, maybe the audience was not very discerning.<br /><br />Whatever the case, Click didn't work for me. I didn't like Sandler. I didn't like the comedic or dramatic elements. In fact, the only things saving this were Kate Beckinsale, who I would watch sit in a chair for 90 minutes and Christopher Walken, who always turns in a fair performance.<br /><br />4/10: Your time could be better spent in another film."
"33716_0.txt",170,"There were way too many holes in the plot to make this movie worth watching for everyone that likes the actors or genre. The only reason I watched the entire movie was because, as a woman, seeing the massive revenge against rapists was very satisfying. One of those rare moments in which the woman isn't continually re-victimized. I thought Oldman's performance was a little more natural than that of Rhames, but his was still decent. I can't say all women would gain anything by seeing rapists tortured. It's dicey. I gave it a 3 out of 10. My feeling is that veterans such as Rhames and Oldman should have seen all of the mistakes in dialog and plot consistency and maybe passed on it altogether. If you're up and bored in the middle of the night while it's on a movie channel, you might as well watch it."

"27135_0.txt",172,"After all the bad reviews I read of this movie, I was dreading watching it. But it actually exceeded my expectations!! It's really fun! Don't listen to all the negative reviews. This was actually a very suspenseful, entertaining, low-budget SCI FI movie! Yes, there are some Alien elements in it of course, but I think the actors performances were really very good. Tara Buckman is fantastic as a ""Linda Hamilton"" type heroine. I really enjoyed her performance - she definitely leads the movie, and I have to say she's got wickedly cool hair too! She was a knockout in a Buck Rogers episode ('Unchained Woman') from the 70's. I was worried that Jan Michael Vincent would be alcohol-deadened, but he actually turns in an admirable performance as well! I know he's older, but some of that 80's 'action star' persona comes through really nicely, and he still has amazing charisma in front of the camera. It's also a treat to see a young Nicolas Lea (from the X Files) in this - battling aliens, no less! The alien itself is pretty interesting - nothing as scary as 'Aliens', but it's pretty cool special effects. Enjoy this movie- it's fun!!!!"

What started out with so much promise (Donald Sutherland) just blathered away into a Jane Austinique exercise in excess.

Hey its a spoof of a spoof.

"28797_0.txt",176,"Charles Chaplin was truly the first independent filmmaker - with the exception perhaps of Georges Melies. Chaplin wrote, directed, starred in and scored nearly all of his films. No one understood the craft of film-making (silent or otherwise) better than Chaplin. He never compromised his artistic vision, perfectionism, or his integrity. Charlie literally made his films up as he went along, rehearsing on film and discarding whatever didn't work. Such techniques would prove too costly and time consuming today. This documentary consists of some of Chaplin's best experiments - some of which he re-shot and much of which he ordered burned. Like many a magician, Chaplin didn't want his secrets getting out. Luckily, many of his best tricks are revealed here for posterity. It's all lovingly narrated by James Mason. And the scenes that were cut from THE CIRCUS, CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES are as good as anything that ended up in the final releases. I wish this was available on DVD, as my tapes are beginning to wear out."
"49050_0.txt",177,"I caught 'Spy Hard' on television the other night, and the film really took me back to the early 1990s. I noticed Weird Al right away from his part singing the theme song. 'Spy Hard's' purpose is to create a comical version of James Bond and similar spy-themed films. Some of the comedy is very funny, but some of it wears thin throughout the film. (You'll either enjoy the sense of humour, or you will hate it.) WD40 is a great name for the secret agent, and Mr. T even makes an appearance. There is also a lot of adult-themed humour. By the end of the film, I was ready for it to be finished. It's funny, but it's not brilliant, but I cannot complain because it did let me laugh. If you like Austin Powers, you will probably like this, even though it is not as popular. It will also take you right back to the early 1990s. Not a perfect film, it does have some good humour."
"20784_0.txt",178,"I'm glad I wasn't in the UK's Celebrity Big Brother House this year. Not because I wouldn't have enjoyed meeting some of the others, but because at one stage fellow house mate Verne Troyer might have asked me about the last film he did with his best friend, and I wouldn't be comfortable lying to him and denying that I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.<br /><br />Hey, I like Mike Myers. He has a measure of talent and charisma and likability, and I applaud his deserved financial and critical success with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers films (though he went one movie too far with Goldmember). Having said that, Myers, like his fellow SNL alumnus Will Ferrell, is like a kid wandering about a shop eating food off the shelves and generally behaving like someone in desperate need of supervision and guidance. Let's be honest, Ferrell's last decent leading role was in Anchorman (2004), and while he's been fine in supporting work like The Producers (2005), everything else that he's had a hand in has been a series of embarrassments of varying levels. And sadly, Myers can too easily fall into the same degree of arrested development.<br /><br />People who know me know that I may go on about a lot of bad movies, but more often than not, I enjoyed watching them, and perversely can watch them again. This one, however, I'm ashamed that I ever wasted bandwidth getting it, let alone consider watching it again.<br /><br />Myers' characters have always been one-note, with a limited appeal. But his latest Guru Pitka went too far when he thought of writing it down; in comparison, his Beatnik poet Charlie from So I Married An Axe Murderer (1993) was a character of multi-layered nuance, and more importantly, one that people would much rather watch. The very concept should have been seen as potentially execrable and insulting to Hindus. Yes, I know he tries to get around this in the movie by claiming that Pitka wasn't really a Hindu, but an American raised by Hindus, but like so much else in this movie, that attempt fails miserably given what passes for humor.<br /><br />Hey, I like Dumb Humor  when it's done right. Dodgeball, Epic Movie, Jay and Silent Bob. But the gags in The Love Guru come in three flavors: racist, gross and infantile, and in various mixtures thereof. The racist names he came up with (Harenmahkeester, Satchabigknoba) is the sort of thing an ignorant ten-year-old kid would come up with to make the other ignorant ten-year-old kids in the playground laugh. Yes, isn't it hilarious that Indian people all have big long names? The rest of the atrocity is filled with other dodgy names like Coach Cherkov and Dick Pants, as well as alleged jokes about snot balls and nose hairs, humping elephants, food prepared to look like genitals, and buckets of urine  all of which probably would have sounded funny in 1988 in the writers' brainstorming sessions in the SNL offices at 3am when you're doped up on caffeine, but I honestly can't believe that a 45-year-old man wrote this crap down in 2008 and thought this would be funny in any other circumstances.<br /><br />And the execution of these so-called gags is almost consistently accompanied by Myers with the same sort of mugging grin to the camera that he perfected with Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers  the difference here being that those other characters had moments where they really were humorous, but seeing Myers try it with Pitka is akin to watching an inept magician fail every trick, but still take a rehearsed bow after each one, oblivious to the negative reaction he's getting from his audience. And worse, he drives the jokes so deep into the ground, again and again, you expect them to bump into Hilary Swank piloting her subterranean machine around the Earth's Core.<br /><br />And the storyline carrying these non-gags, like the sores on the back of a leper, is just as awful: a guru seeking fame and a spot on Oprah counsels a Canadian hockey player who wants to win back his wife from a rival, Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, who apparently is well-endowed (Get it? Le Coq Grande?). Another lesson to learn, Mike: Sports Themes Aren't Funny. Canadian Sports Themes Aren't Funny, Cubed. It may give you the chance to hang about with your heroes, but it's a waste of time for the rest of us. Some have tried to point out the satire in Pitka's self-help philosophies, but satire only works when it makes a point, and doesn't just appear indistinguishable from the targets it's allegedly satirizing.<br /><br />In case I haven't made it clear, this is a Bad Film. Not So Bad It's Good, like The Oxford Murders (2008). This is embarrassing on levels I haven't seen in ages. Some bad movies have people in it who can rise above the mediocrity, but this one is like quicksand, sucking people down and suffocating them. And I'm not talking about the likes of Verne Troyer, Jessica Alba and Justin Timberlake, who were basically employees who probably needed the money, or the cameos from Oprah and Val Kilmer. I'm talking about Ben F**king Kingsley.<br /><br />How does a respected Oscar winner go from playing Gandhi to playing Guru Tugginmypudha?"

Debbie is wonderfully voiced by Danielle Harris, and is seen as a typical teenager, pretty, funny and sometimes grumpy. Debbie is a great teenage representation. The parents add a lot to the show, especially Nigel, who has some of the funniest lines of the whole show, and if you have the wonderful Tim Curry on board you can never go wrong.

Malcolm McDowell also gives a magnetic performance as the older version of Paul Bettany's character many years later. David Thewlis and Saffron Burrows give good support in this classic gangster masterpiece. <br /><br />the film is very original for its intense and very violent scenes that will shock any audience that watch it. the tracking shots and music really go well with this film. there really isn't a problem i can say with this, maybe the film should be on for a little longer because of the shortness of it due to so many other gangster classics surpassing the 2 hour mark.<br /><br />all in all this film is brilliant.

"3281_0.txt",185,"I am a very tolerant viewer. I enjoy almost every film I see, even if it is not the best film ever made. However, this motion picture directly challenges the tolerance that I have for filmed entertainment. ""Strategic Command"" is easily THE WORST film I have ever had the misfortune to watch. It is an almost identical clone to the vastly superior ""Executive Decision"" with elements from ""The Rock"" thrown in to try and (In a pathetic attempt if I may add.) to distinguish it from the aforementioned films. Although there are some differences in the film (The jet that docks with the 747 in ""Strategic Command"" is an SR-71 while the jet in ""Executive Decision"" is an F-117.), these differences are not enough to keep the film from being a mediocre imitation. Special effects are mostly poorly executed, although some of the matte shots did seem convincing. Parts of the film where some of the bad guys and a good guy vomits looked like they put an Alka Seltzer tablet in their mouth and would spit the foam out at the right time to emulate vomit. Some of the footage of the F-16s, both interior and exterior, were taken directly from the film ""Iron Eagle"" so as to save money on the limited production budget. Acting is another weak point, with people playing their parts too hard. As a result, the characters become unconvincing and lifeless. The only good actor in the film was Paul Winfield. I was shocked to see how low Mr. Winfield sunk, his acting talent could've served in better films than this. The film's only saving grace is the musical score, sounding better than most other low budget and even some high budget films. However, it seems that the composer was trying to emulate and, in some parts of the suite, combine the styles Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner. Most of the suite, although is surprisingly good for a no-name composer, is mostly unoriginal and uninspired. Overall, ""Strategic Command"" is a mediocre facsimilie of ""Executive Decision"". This is a film that deserves to stay in a vault and rot away. The video does not deserve to be purchased, even five dollars for this movie is highway robbery! This picture can, at the very best, serve as a rental, but there are better choices at the video store. Besides, this film is nothing but two hours of your life that can be spent watching a better film. After seeing this review, your brain should be giving an excellent ""Strategic Command"" to steer clear of this stinker! - Reinhart"
"43261_0.txt",186,"A couple of weeks ago I had a get together with a bunch of Matt Johnson ( Aka The The ) fans down in London and a couple of people I'd met there , namely Duncan and Ange , had like me attended film school . As in these type of situations the topic of conversation soon got round to lamenting the demise of the British film industry . It may sound bitter but we all agreed that the reason was because the industry in this country is crippled by nepotism with people getting their movies financed simply because they know the right people , not because they have any obvious talent <br /><br />MAD COWS is a case in point . Apparently it's based on a novel by Australian Kathy Lette which probably explains how her husband Geoffry Robertson managed to get a walk on part in this movie . Robertson isn't a professional actor which means a member of Equity has been deprived of an income . Actually at least one other actor has also been deprived since Mohamed Al Fayed the owner of Harrods also appears in a walk on part . As for the actors who have paid their dues to Equity I wasn't impressed . Anna Friel spends the movie with an entirely unconvincing Aussie accent while Joanna Lumley is abysmal since she recreates her role as Patsy Stone from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS <br /><br />The supporting cast I will reserve judgement on because I've a feeling that the director Sara Sugarman is more to blame than the actors themselves . A case in point is an interrogation by a detective who has arrested the heroine for stealing a packet of frozen peas ( A pathetic plot twist ? Glad you agree with me ) and my gut instinct is that the scene was hopelessly unfunny to begin with but instead of the director beating the screenwriter to death with a limp script Ms Sugarman has told the actor in question to put on a funny speech impediment and other clown mannerisms . No doubt the cast have nothing but kind words about working with Sara Sugerman but you don't make a movie to enjoy yourself - You make a movie to let the audience enjoy themself and there's no enjoyment here as we have to endure silly performances , MTV style direction in a very plot less and episodic story that is a kick in the guts to anyone who has struggled to make it in the movie business in this country <br /><br />But at least MAD COWS proves once and for all that it's not what you know in the British movie industry - It's who you know"
"15091_0.txt",187,"Hitchcock made a lot of great films, many of which have been met with the acclaim that they rightly deserve. Lifeboat deserves a lot of acclaim, yet its lesser-known status doesn't allow justice in that respect. This film represents one of Hitchcock's major successes in scene setting and drawing the audience into the story. The way that Hitchcock uses his camera aboard the lifeboat is amazing, as by keeping the action on the claustrophobic craft, the great director ensures that his audience is always plugged into the plight of his characters; which helps the film no end when it comes to the story, as we know their situation at all times. In fact, it's amazing just how well Hitchcock does do this; while they were starving, I was too! The plot is simple, yet a great base for a wartime thriller. We follow the surviving members of a crew from a ship that was bombed by a German U-Boat. They're crammed onto a small lifeboat, but there's one survivor that isn't quite welcome. His name is Willy, and he's a survivor of the U-Boat that sank the ill-fated ship.<br /><br />Given the time when this was made (towards the end of World War 2), it's hardly surprising that it's filled with propaganda. Usually, this annoys me; but here it's done really well, and the propaganda is actually worked into the story instead of just being there to rally the allied population at the time. Hitchcock turns this into a twist, and the way that he parodies the war on the whole on just a small lifeboat in the middle of the big ocean is great. The entire film takes place on just one single set. The action never leaves the lifeboat (aside from to pan around the surrounding area), but Hitchcock uses this to his advantage. The lack of locations really enforces the crew's isolation. The acting is melodramatic in typical forties fashion; but all of the cast members do well in their roles. Tallulah Bankhead takes the lead role and really is the linchpin of the movie. She is joined by the likes of William Bendix, Walter Slezak and John Hodiak, who give great turns despite not being A-class actors. Overall, this is a Hitchcock film that I would say is just as important to see as the likes of Rear Window and Strangers on a Train. This is Hitchcock at his best, and the film is a great ninety-five minutes to boot. Don't miss this one!"

Little Dakota Fanning ,who plays Emily,is absolutely awesome in this film and i will be watching her career closely in the future and though this is the sort of role Robert DE Niro,the dad,could play in his sleep,he still puts in a great though slightly muted performance. This film has everything,imaginary friends,murdered pets ,suspicious deaths and enough nail biting horror to keep you awake for a fortnight. Next time your child tells you of imaginary friend then you might want to think twice because you never know...........8/10"
"37156_0.txt",190,"Some of the cheapest looking CGI creatures you'll ever see attack some of the most poorly trained mercenary troops to ever brandish fake looking weapons on a bogus ""South Sea island"" set (in Canada). The goofs are endless, the script resembles mangled Swiss cheese, and the story is pretty much a chaotic maze of nothingness.<br /><br />The Raptor attacks are priceless. Usually they stand around, hanging out in groups doing nothing, as nitwit Green Beret wanna-be's pepper them with hundreds of rounds, and they just kind of stare in stupefied apathy as the useless bullets shower them. One of two things always happens: Either they get sick of being shot at, and they gang tackle the victim and then some animated blood spurts around; or a poorly done CGI red blotch appears on the poor confused Raptor and it drops over in a heap, never losing that silly grin they always seem to have. The chronological order for the victims-to-be is so obvious, they might as well have had numbers painted on their faces.<br /><br />Viewers definitely need to ""turn off the brain"" for this material. The writer, director, and cast certainly did."
"3644_0.txt",191,"I watched this movie with a friend from Japan who had a very high opinion it. I must say it was helpful to have her watching the movie with us (in our college dorm), however, because she explained a number of things about Japanese tax code and evasion as well as the Japanese mafia that made the plot (and politics) of the story much easier to follow. Aside from potential confusion in that area, I must say that I enjoyed the movie. Yes, there is sex, suspense, and the mafia, but don't expect it to flow like a mindless crime thriller (read: it isn't mindless, and it isn't non-stop action). It is about a tax woman, after all--the only woman amongst her coworkers. The characters are interesting and the story keeps you thinking. A smart movie with a few things to say along the way. Overall, I thought it was a good, but not great, movie. However, if you like this genre in general, you might enjoy it more than I did."

"1897_0.txt",202,"I really have to ask myself what I expected from a movie that has Ron Pallilio from Welcome Back Kotter as the male lead sex symbol. Not much, I guess and that's exactly what I got! Not much! When I popped the DVD of Hellgate on I realized less than five minutes into it that I had seen this movie over ten years ago. You don't forget acting this bad! So the movie starts with three friends waiting for their fourth friend Matt (Horseshack!) to show up at their vacation spot. They while away the time telling ghost stories. One girl deadpans the tale of The Legend Of Hellgate, which is apparently the next town over. In a flashback we see an attempted rape gone bad that happened in Hellgate in the '50s. A bunch of no-good-nick bikers are at the malt shop and they decide to grab the big cheese mayor of Hellgate's daughter Josie and drive away with her. None of the town folk try to stop them. They drive Josie to a secluded area and rip her skirt off and Josie runs around in black underwear, bobby socks and sneakers looking like she should be doing an 80s aerobics video. (I swear they hired Abigail Wolcott to play ""Josie"" because she had nice legs...She even ""strikes poses"" while being carried away and raped! ) Well, her father - who is a dead ringer for Gomez Addams- comes to rescue her and in the process Josie gets iced.<br /><br />Later on a guy in a mine finds a strange crystal that has the power to reanimate dead things. Here is where the cheesy special effects (""done by the people who did the effects in Hellraiser and Hellbound "" the box trumpets!) debut as we see a very fake looking bat, a very fake looking fish and a very fake looking turtle spring back to murderous mutant life. (The turtle scene is actually pretty funny). Josie's papa goes to Josie's shrine (even her headstone has breast implants!) and reserrects Josie so she can lure people to the ghost town for him to kill. Why? I don't know why! Josie picks up Horseshack on the side of the road and seduces him. The seduction scene is a laugh riot! the music is insane! And I had never realized what a bad actor Horseshack is until I saw this: Even his sex scenes are unconvincing! And he's a pretty small guy. When he's lying in bed with Josie naked he's so small compared to her that he looks like a doll! Hahaha! Matt meets up with his friends and drags THEM to Hellgate . Why? I don't know. But they go. And of course they run afoul some zombie ghost town people who chase them around and try to kill them. Josie falls in love with Matt for reasons unknown and Matt's girlfriend is not amused.<br /><br />Will Matt stay with the living dead girl or go home with his plain Jane girlfriend? Or will the zombies and John Astin's doppelganger kill him? Hellgate is a terrible film all the way around with bad acting, bad script, bad special effects, etc. but there was something FUNNY about it that kept me watching so if you like bad movies like I do you might actually find some entertainment in watching HELLGATE. I will watch it again one day just to watch Josie strike strange Vogue-like poses, a dead turtle bite someones face off and to see Horseshack in the raw again. Comic gold all three! <br /><br />Speaking of bad movies, if you are lucky you will get the two disc set that not only has Hellgate but also has The Pit. The Pit is even funnier than Hellgate, a real laugh riot! So check that one out! Peace!"
"14351_0.txt",203,"Bette Davis and Leslie Howard give classic 30's performances while Humphrey Bogart gives one for all ages around the interior of a roadside dirty spoon and filling station in the American South West. Meanwhile director Archie Mayo stays out of the way in filming what is basically a two set stage play. <br /><br />Based on the Sherwood Anderson Depression era play about a hostage situation and the cross section of people it brings together it's a touch dated but nearly the entire cast is flawless with Bogart's Duke Mantee holding center stage. He's one of the darkest villains in film history but by risking everything to meet up his moll becomes every bit the romantic the well versed wandering dreamer Allan Squier is. Leslie Howard is charmingly, fatalistic, Bette Davis has never been more cute and innocent and this could be 100 plus film actor Charlie Grapewin's finest performance.<br /><br />Interspersed between the hostage situation and the romance of the star struck lovers is a socially conscious message that mocks a rising fascism with a buffoonish para-military local group and raises questions regarding other ills plaguing the country at the time. One minor but intriguing scene between the black gang member and the very staid black chaueffeur of the wealthy hostages raises an interesting message about equality. <br /><br />One could argue that if they'd moved this play off the stage and given it to Milestone and his tracking obsession it might have made a finer film.

"38692_0.txt",206,"I sadly to say go with the latter. I only recently became interested in Haneke's work after viewing Funny Games, being completely hypnotized and blown away by the magnificent work. ""Cache"" was enjoyable to me but I was hoping for more, I've seen plenty of European cinema, hundreds, but the ending was just too disappointing.<br /><br />I made it an effort to see every Haneke film on DVD possible, starting in chronological order I watched this film and was just utterly taken aback by it instantly. I think to really comment on cinema one needs to be objective and know history of films similar to this type of intense plodding character (in this case family) study. To put it simply if it wasn't for being able to fast forward with subtitles still on I would have stopped this film within 30 minutes. The die-hard film lover in me pressed on expecting something important from this.<br /><br />Let it be said, I never heard the hype surrounding this film nor did I view this IMDb page until AFTER I saw it. Complete 100% unbiased opinion and I thought it was trash. I fully understand someone can argue the idea it was so plodding and boring is because it's a film detailing how monotonous a life in the 21st century can get. To me, he easily could have shortened the film down, hell this could have been a short film reeling no more than 30 minutes and get the point across. After scene after scene it becomes obvious to the viewer the style he is going for, eventually turning predictable. You get where he's going with the film and just want the pay off already. It comes and in my case I was left wondering what a waste of time.<br /><br />Film in the past has done a better and more remarkable job getting across the point of alienation humans can feel in modern society. Better pacing, establishing reason and emotions for characters, not over-indulging in film techniques. Instead this film displayed trite and mind-numbingly boring imagery. One of the worst art house films I've ever seen. A shame real fish had to die or suffer for this film. Haneke is clearly an auteur and I can only hope his films get better with each successor."
"10367_0.txt",207,"The premise of this film isn't exactly original, but a story like this has great potential both for a psychological thriller and for a fun horror flick...but unfortunately, Or Unknown Origin doesn't quite manage to excel at being either. The focus is more on the battle between man and rat than providing the sort of schlocky horror that the eighties produced so prolifically, which is fine; but it never probes too deep into the psyche of the central character, and the film plays out like a movie that should be fun, but largely isn't. That's not to say that it's a bad film, however, as there are a lot of good ideas on display, and the film also features what may be a career best performance from Peter Weller. The plot sees a man who recently completed the rebuilding of a house being left alone when his wife and child go on holiday. He stays behind to try and win a promotion, but he doesn't count on an onslaught of torture when it turns out that the house he put together has become infested by a rat. What follows is an all out war between man and one of the world's most notorious pests.<br /><br />Rats are one of horror cinema's most popular animals, and it's not hard to see why. There is a scene in this film that sees the central character make a case against rats, and it really makes you realise the reason why these animals are so often feared. Of Unknown Origin starts out slowly, but builds some momentum half way through when our hero begins his personal war against nature. I wasn't expecting much after the first half hour, but the film surprised me somewhat by the way it eventually comes together, climaxing with an exciting sequence that sees the central character really go off the rails. Peter Weller really is superb in the lead role, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film was the reason he went on to take the lead role in the classic Sci-Fi thriller 'Robocop'. It's a shame that director George P. Cosmatos doesn't seem too keen to get fully inside the character's head, as the potential for a great psychological thriller is definitely there. This film may have been better if it was handled by someone like David Lynch, but despite its imperfections; Of Unknown Origin is still worth seeing."

"4105_0.txt",209,"Hitchcock, of course, understood exactly how to create suspense. His typical explanation involved a bomb under the table: if it explodes out of nowhere, then that's surprise. If the audience knows that the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off, that's suspense. Thus, the secret for mastering suspense was to allow the audience to know something that the film's characters didn't  for, whatever we may know, we are absolutely helpless to do anything. Hitchcock occasionally transferred the elements of this director/audience interaction to his own characters, as we see in 'Rear Window (1954),' in which Jimmy Stewart sits immobile and helpless in his apartment. ""Breakdown"" (Season 1, Episode 7) was the second episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" to be personally directed by the host, and, tellingly, it's also the best of the series so far. Hitchcock once again utilises the premise of a central character who, like the audience, is powerless to influence the events of the story.<br /><br />Joseph Cotten plays William Callew, a callous businessman with little regard for human emotion. After a long-time employee weeps uncontrollably after losing his job, Callew unsympathetically condemns his lack of self-control. However, poetic justice is about to ensue. After becoming involved in a ghastly car collision with a truck of chain-gang prisoners, Callew wakes up paralysed from head to toe, but conscious enough to thinking logically. The fleeing prisoners offer hope of rescue, but instead  believing him to be dead  seize the opportunity to loot his clothing. Despite regaining slight movement in a single finger, nobody seems to recognise that Callew is still alive, and he seems destined to be buried that way. Hitchcock uses point-of-view shots to powerful effect, and Cotten  though not called upon to do much in the way of acting  delivers a creepy monotone voice-over that communicates his overwhelming paranoia. Though a lesson is proposed by the conclusion, its presence seems to be tongue-in-cheek, with Hitchcock spelling out the necessity of a ""moral"" in his introduction."
"26713_0.txt",210,"I first watched this movie under the title of The Grim Reaper. Most of us fans of the movie probably have as well. Surprisingly, I had never heard about this movie until a few years ago. I remember watching it and think that there was something about this movie that was above most of its competition. Of course, I hadn't seen the uncut version of the film yet so I was just going off of the atmosphere. When I was told what I was missing in the uncut version I had to find it. Obviously, I did.

And the 2 particular controversial scenes are great. Sure, the special effects are terrible but it is the thought of what is happening that makes you realize how sick this really is.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of D'amato's works but this movie is excellent. For any real collector of horror, this is a must have. By the way, I did end up picking up The Shiek Show release of the movie. It is well worth having.

After all, this was a real, true-life courtroom drama set in an exotic American locale, with many colorful personalities to weave around the main tale. But the writer of this mess was no weaver, inexplicably adding his own new characters and events and gutting the drama of the crime and its subsequent legal and social effects. He didn't think it even worth mentioning, much less emphasizing, that Mr. Williams was subjected to FOUR trials, finally achieving an acquittal not in Savannah, where the case and the players were notorious, but upon a change of venue to Augusta, where no one cared. What a wonderful film this could have been about Savannah culture and society in general, and Mr. Williams in particular, as played out against the backdrop of the Georgia legal system. Even as a travelogue, it doesn't work, since not enough of Savannah is shown and described. A total bomb, in my humble opinion, but I gave it a 2 for effort."

"1633_0.txt",216,"It's too bad Andre De Toth didn't contribute more to the noir cycle, because on the evidence he was a natural (plus he was married to early-noir icon Veronica Lake). The Pitfall, made in 1948, looks more and more like one of the best, and most central, movies in the cycle, but (except for the early, more gothic Dark Waters) De Toth only returned to it once, with Crime Wave. Its story is not a fresh one: an ex-con trying to go straight (Gene Nelson) is coerced by circumstances to aid and abet a gang of his former cellmates. The uncomfortable spot he finds himself in lies between them and the law, personified by Sterling Hayden as a tough, unforgiving police detective. There's much more attention to character in the film's hour-and-a-quarter running time than in many full-length features of the era; Jay Novello, as an alcoholic veterinarian who doubles as an underworld sawbones, is especially memorable. By any reckoning Crime Wave is a minor film -- even a minor second feature -- but De Toth lavishes easy expertise on it; it's surprisingly well paced, well shot, as well interestingly cut. Why so many talented directors (many of them refugees from Europe) were relegated, in the 1950s, to ""genre"" movies -- crime dramas, 3-D schlockfests and westerns -- is a puzzle. In any case, I'd give any three of De Toth's westerns AND his House of Wax for just one more film noir boasting his directorial credit."

I wonder why this film was a box office hit in Greece, where I live, since it is such a terrible, anachronistic insult to the country and its people. The direction is mediocre, the actors are worse and the plot is pure trash. It is so ridiculous, so irrelevant to the actual problems of this country, it is a movie that I'd rather forget. Nia Vardalos' ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was a pleasant comedy, nothing special but at least there were some successful puns and originality.

Of course it's Cronenberg's first feature-length film, so it's worth seeing for historical reasons, but the script is boring, monotonous, unfocused and it lacks an engaging protagonist. There are some disturbing moments (the opening fight/murder, where we don't even know who the villain is; the barking kids; the bathtub scene), but the film lacks a clear idea of how it wants to portray the ""infected"" people; most of the time they behave like energetic sex maniacs, but at other times they become the plodding zombies of the ""NOTLD"" variety.

So who is Sadako? She is the embodiment of duality. Good/evil, man/woman, hate/love reality/ unreality and in fact the merger of demon and woman. You have to read the manga (comic book) series to get the background. That duality is what is frightening, especially to people of regimented views of how the world ""should"" be. Things that were once thought to be the realm of only men or women have in modern times become blurred. Japan is about 30 years behind us in the change of sex-rolls, etc. This is the underlying theme of the movie<br /><br />So how do we pick up these ideas? We are of course ""infected"" by the media, and our thinking evolves, and we are no longer who we were. There is naturally no going back. That is progress, though many fight it. What were once evil ideas, become accepted as every day fact. <br /><br />So is Sadako a kind of messiah? The evil one? We also have our own dualities. We can find ourselves beside ourselves with anger, or filled with manic euphoria. We can feel so angry we could... Or, our happiness can seem to radiate to all. <br /><br />I was also really disappointed that in Rasen and Ringu 2 we don't see the wonderful Yukie Nakamura, who just knocks my socks off. Very charming actress. Why we see a substitute in Rasen only makes sense in the context of alternate universes, which may be the point.<br /><br />Where Suzuki is headed with this remains to be seen. The movies might start wading into ""the matrix"", which could tie the story lines together. Can he weave these webs into a consistent story? Hopefully he can keep up the good work. Without the right writer, director and cast, you'll get mush. If they do it right, look out!!!.........<br /><br />As for the American versions...what a disappointment. They just don't get it. The actors were poorly cast. They don't seem to understand how beautiful and quirky people who are very intelligent, can also be really creepy, because they can see and comprehend things faster than the rest of us, but like Cassandra, are sometimes helpless to change things because everyone else is so slow. They live a blessed, but cursed life. Like Sadako, their blessing is also a curse. The tension should lie in pulling us and repelling us. Don't use gore as filler for a poorly written and cast movie. I guess too many studio executives had a hand in the broth."
"24638_0.txt",220,"I read an in-depth article about this series in either ""Filmfax"" or ""Outre"" and it stuck in my mind - I had never heard of the series before. When I saw ""The Very Best of One Step Beyond"" DVD on sale for about $6 - I thought why not buy it??? I have never regretted it. I don't know whether the standard of television is so abysmal now but I have seen half the episodes and apart from 2 (The Aerialist with Mike ""Touch"" Connors and Yvette Vickers and ""The Ordeal on Locust Street"" - just my own personal view) they are all winners. Some of the standouts for me :- ""Night of April 14"" with Patrick Macnee - about a couple that are going on their honeymoon aboard the ""Titanic"". The host then talked about a book that had been published in the 1890s about a ship called the ""Titan"" that could not be sunk<br /><br />- it was very eerie!!! I must say that all the shows are based on real life occurrences. ""The Return of Michael Campion"" with Patrick O'Neal - about a man that holidays on a remote island - yet all the locals know him and dislike him!!! That show was a talking point all the afternoon - how could that happen etc. ""The Vision"" with Pernell Roberts about a group of soldiers in World War 1 that see a strange glow in the sky. I have read of a few different people who saw the same glow in different parts of the world at the very same time. ""The Dark Room"" with Cloris Leachman - about a strange man that consents to be photographed. ""Echo"" with Ross Martin, about a man's murderous past that catches up with him. Joanne Linville was in a couple and made an impression. ""Delusion"" starred the lovely Susanne Pleschette and ""The Visitor"" has a young and very handsome Warren Beatty.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
"48934_0.txt",221,"Scorsese isn't what he used to be and as a Scorsese lover this pains me to say so. He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought 'hmmm. What did I used to do that made me great? I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy."

"41539_0.txt",224,"Any film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino should be great, but ""Serpico"" is mediocre at best. Chronicling the true-life story of Frank Serpico, a police officer who exposed corruption in the NYPD, the film comes from that exquisite golden age of cinema, lasting from the late '60s through the late '70s, when paranoia infected the country and our most trusted and honored institutions were becoming suspect. It's got the grainy, neo-realistic feel that so many of the films from that time period had (and as many of Lumet's own films had), yet it never really works. Lumet's pacing is poor; no scene lasts longer than a minute or two. While one would think this would make for a film with some narrative drive to it, just the opposite happens. It's as if in the editing room all of the important parts of each scene got left out, and what we've been given as a final product is an outline of Serpico's story. No characters beyond Pacino's is really developed, and even he struggles to make something substantial out of his role. This came directly on the heels of ""The Godfather"" from the year before, the film that put Pacino on the map. ""Serpico"" gives testament to Pacino's abilities and range as an actor; his performance is quite different from that of Michael Corleone. But for me, it's not until his mesmerizing performance in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" from 1975 that Pacino really flexes his acting muscles and shows what a true cinematic treasure he is. 26 years later, Pacino was to star in ""The Insider,"" another thriller where he played a character who helps to expose corruption, this time in the world of corporate America. My advice is to see ""Serpico"" for the place it holds in Pacino's career, but then see ""The Insider"" for a suspenseful, terrific movie.<br /><br />Grade: C"
"24102_0.txt",225,"This movie spelled the end for the Pink Panther series. Not only would most never wish to see another one, most would wish that they had not wasted time on this one. It proved that Peter Sellers is and always will be the one and ONLY ... Inspector Jacques Clouseau. It's hard to believe that Blake Edwards would allow this travesty to be seen. It goes beyond disappointment. This film should be burned and all those who had anything to do with it should deny association to it. I know that I do not wish to admit to viewing it. It's got to finish in the 10 worst comedy motion pictures of all time. The sooner that I can forget it, the better. Roberto Benigni is worse than Alan Arkin at acting or comedy. I don't normally cast such a final judgement, but this movie is TERRIBLE. I can't see how anyone could say that they enjoyed any of it. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, like in the the Peter Sellers installments. It never did."
"25978_0.txt",226,"Screenwriter and director Noah Baumbach's tale of his incredibly dysfunctional family could easily have been re-named ""The Addams Family - 1986"". The film recounts his ugly childhood with his younger brother, his writer-father and aspiring writer-mother living in Park Slope, Brooklyn in 1986. His father Bernard, played revoltingly well by Jeff Daniels, has absolutely no concept of what's going on outside of his own world as he spews obscenities and dwells on his past as a respected writer; of course now no one wants anything to do with his writing so he teaches English instead (Gee, haven't we see that a few hundred times in films?)Bernard's wife Joan, played by a mousy Laury Linney, decide that after many years of marriage that divorce is the best option; which seems odd considering that they have nothing good to say about each other and that Joan has had affairs with at least four different men during their marriage. Why they don't continue with this nightmarish marriage isn't explained; there isn't a catalyst for this decision. Once the separation occurs and Bernard relocates several blocks away to a house of lesser amenities the film shifts focus to the effect the separation has on the two children; Walt and Frank Berkman. Walt, played by a brow-furrowed Jesse Eisenberg, idolizes his father and models his view of the world after Bernard's twisted vision. The majority of observations from Walt's mouth are direct quotes from his father, yet instead of revealing the depth of admiration Walt has for his father these comments simply show Walt as being shallow and pathetic. We wait for Walt to develop a mind of his own but sadly that never happens. Frank, played mincingly by Owen Kline, steals the film as the repulsive chronic masturbator who leaves his calling card on any non-human surface. At one point Joan and Bernard get their child custody duties mixed up and accidentally leave Frank alone for three days. Frank spends the time drinking Scotch, masturbating to his mom's underwear, and passing out on the bathroom floor. The next scene is Joan and Bernard being confronted by the school counselor. What happened for the rest of Frank's long weekend? A nine year old boy left alone with hard liquor and a Oedipal complex is a film in itself, but we aren't allowed to witness this, or a scene where the parents find Frank near death from alcohol poisoning (assuming that could have easily happened) lying in a pile of his mother's panties. The rest of the film is filled with Walt's blatant plagiarism, a non-stop stream of offensive cursing, arguments, premature ejaculation, Bernard allowing his dinner guests at restaurants to only order half-orders because he's so cheap, unbelievable therapy sessions, Bernard trying to force his female student and border to perform oral sex only to be interrupted by his son, and a medical emergency that is offered as redemption but fails. Contrary to reviews I've read, there is nothing charming, endearing, funny, or clever about this film. It truly boggles my mind that most critics enjoyed this film. The only reason I can conjure is that most of these critics were raised in a family as hellish as this one so it's like spending time with old, heavily medicated friends. If this film's final scene was of the four Berkman's going for a hot air balloon ride over the Catskills, and the balloon crashing in flames into the mountains with no survivors, then I just might have walked out of the theater with a smile on my face. As it is, this a slice of American ugliness that no one should have to endure."
"2132_0.txt",227,"This is very possibly the finest animation I've seen. Before commenting on the film as a whole, I want to make that clear, because in the inevitable rush to pick this film apart (the plot, the voices, the religious significance, the literary accuracy, the moral issues, the music, the comparisons with Disney and de Mille, etc...) one might easily become distracted from the aesthetic and technical triumphs of The Prince of Egypt, and that would be unfortunate. As someone who has an interest and appreciation of animation, I can say that this is the first film I've seen that successfully integrates computer-generated animation and traditional animation (and I've seen many attempts). More importantly, as someone who has eyes, I can say that the result is a visual experience of intense style and beauty. In fact, the initial depiction of Egypt is so breathtaking, that it seriously hinders the film's later efforts to vilify it.<br /><br />Comparisons with Disney are inevitable, especially because Prince of Egypt employs tired Disney formula in an attempt, I assume, to remain economically viable. What a shame, since Disney hasn't made a decent film since Aladdin. I am referring, of course, to the unnecessary musical numbers and the two high priests, the film's comic relief, who are drawn grossly out of proportion to the other characters. Even worse than their unoriginality, however, is the open mockery of ancient Egyption religion and culture, which these two characters embody. I found their musical number especially appalling. On the other hand, it's a story in which the protagonists succeed only through a greater capacity for cruelty and destruction and the slaughter of innocent children, so it's kind of hard to nail down any concrete moral standard here.<br /><br />In general, I thought the story was well told, with solid direction and a good script. The only complaint I have about the voice acting is that Jeff Goldblum's unmistakable mannerisms seriously distract from his character. I suspect that I wasn't really bothered by the others only because I hadn't seen a cast list before seeing the film. I wish they would stop relying on celebrity voices for animated features. No character can be effective if the viewer can't separate the voice from the actor supplying it.<br /><br />The bottom line is, despite any objections, complaints, or concerns I might have about this film, despite the moral, religious, or idealogical issues it brings up, and despite the $8 and two hours you'll spend, this film is worth seeing. It's worth seeing because of the animation. I hope it sets a new standard for feature-length animated films. At the very least, I think it will show the movie-going public what the medium is capable of."
"49627_0.txt",228,"Well, given that the first Dragonheart was no Citizen Kane - heck, it wasn't even an Excalibur in itself - my expectations were low for this movie. And those expectations were met in full. Dragonheart: ANB builds on the contrivances of the first and offers its own; now there's a new semi-evil ruler guy (you'll love his beginning speech decreeing that citizens must always speak the truth), a new convenient dragon (whose 'ice lung' ability is just a little too powerful) and a wimpy hero who learns to deal between the two, sort of.<br /><br />One of the more humorous things about ANB is its unnatural PG rating, which means swordfights and such must be bloodless. It makes many of the fight scenes more laughable than they are naturally, which is considerable already. And it gives no particular creedence to the inevitable dragon-heart-changing-sequence, which you know must be coming - you just don't quite know where. Sigh. I shouldn't waste much more time on this. It's a fun dumb movie, but don't expect much more from it. At least they didn't contrive a romance between the hero and the 'foreigner' bodyguard, who is quite clearly female but at whom every character seems surprised to discover this fact."
"20975_0.txt",229,"I have not been the same since viewing this film. It is disturbing to be sure. But it is also a transforming film, one that pushes the limits and boundaries of what it means to live out one's faith. War is hell. Can forgiveness and redemption be found in the bowels of war? I am convinced that this film, based on a true story, proves it can be found even there. The actors -- an international ensemble from North America, Europe and Asia -- are superb. You forget you're watching a film. It avoids the political, I think. The Japanese characters were a bit stereotyped at first, but they became real, nuanced, textured, and very believable as the story unfolded. And the actual meeting of the two former, reconciled enemies at the end is a master stroke. The makers of this film strived for greatness in this film, and I think they achieved it."
"1877_0.txt",230,"This movie clearly suffers from a syndrome that was quite common the world of 80's horror cinema; namely the identity crisis. Like so many other contemporary horror flicks, ""Horror House on Highway Five"" isn't exactly sure whether it wants to be a comedy/spoof movie or a full-blooded slasher picture. Obviously back then it was more interesting to make a spoof, since there already was an over-production of regular teen slashers, but efficient comedy and genuine horror are two incredibly difficult ingredients to mix into one scenario. Writer/director Richard Casey here in this case completely failed to put the two genres in the blender together and what came out is an embarrassing amateur horror production with retarded jokes and over-the-top clichéd situations that aren't the least bit funny or inventive; not even when you're in a slight state of drunk or stoned. A wannabe occultist intends to resurrect a mad German scientist named Bartholomew Steiner and kidnaps a female student working on a thesis about the same notorious historical figure. Meanwhile there's a maniac, disguised in a Richard Nixon face mask, prowling around the titular highway and terrorizing teenagers. I know it's a long shot, but if you fancy sheer lunacy and incoherence, you'll love ""Horror House on Highway Five"". Everything to make film insufferable and irritating is overly well-presented, like atrocious music, tripe acting performances and clumsy direction. It's boring beyond words and doesn't contain any worthwhile moments of bloodshed, neither. One to avoid at all costs. If you really want to see an 80's movie that combines horror and parody reasonably adequate, check out ""Student Bodies""."
"8905_0.txt",231,"I was quite pleased not to have found this film, nor Grace/Annabel, to be as depressing and fatalistic as others on the IMDB would have one believe. Though Grace certainly appears to have fallen victim to those in the porn industry who only want to exploit her, and though she seems to have been effectively ""castrated"" by mainstream public perception of her, I don't think any of this makes her social/political observations less worthy of consideration. Sadly, Grace does not seem to able to publicly express her points very well (we are told by former teachers that she's a very good writer, however), and the filmmakers don't help matters much by painting her pretty much as totally alone in her beliefs (despite the fact these pro-sex ""feminist"" arguments have been around for at least 15 years).<br /><br />Finally, I find complaints that the film was not ""fun"" a bit beside the point. Frankly, it gives one cause to wonder if some of these people came to the film expecting to get aroused, and when they didn't, they chose to look no deeper."
"1544_0.txt",232,"I was eight years old when I first saw this movie on the big screen in 1942. It was my first color movie and the scenes with the giant octopus gave me nightmares for a long time after. Today I still enjoy the film for its beautiful color photography, exciting sea scenes and fine performances from Ray Milland and John Wayne. Wayne is unjustly accused of causing his ship to sink for profit. The story unfolds as he tries to clear his name .Paulette Goddard provides the love interest. The film never drags,whether on land or at sea where some of the most exciting action takes place.The underwater scenes,especially the finale ,are memorable. Supporting cast, score and special effects are all top notch.DeMille directs in his usual showman style. A fine effort from all concerned."
"42270_0.txt",233,"I think this movie is a disservice to Alan Turing. He was the undisputed leader of the team that took the initial Polish work to break the Enigma Code, broke subsequent variations (such as for the naval Enigma machines) and automated the whole thing by creating one of the world's first computers called BOMBE. His work thus directly brought World War II to an early end and saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the process. He was also the founder of modern day computers and artificial intelligence (just Google 'Turing Test'). Why create a fictional story? In telling the story truthfully, they would have to touch on the fact that Alan Turing was gay. In 1952 he was arrested for being gay, was chemically castrated, and had all security clearance stripped. He committed suicide in 1954. Was it so unpalatable to tell the truth that the main character in this story was gay (as were thousands of soldiers who fought in WWII)? I think that story is more compelling. Are we so sanitized that he had to be replaced with a team of straight matinée idols? Alan Turing was one of the most important figures of the 20th century, and one of the most slighted. I wish someone would make a decent movie telling his story. You can sign a petition asking the British Government to apologize for the prosecution and castration of this war hero here: http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/turing/"
"47857_0.txt",234,"The first time I saw this on Comedy Central, about a year ago, I thought it was incredibly funny. Lampanelli does have a gift for spouting out crass opinions in a deadpan style that keeps building one shock on top of another until you can't help laughing. I felt much like those in the film's audience appear, initially wanting to be offended and superior, eventually guffawing against my will.<br /><br />The show wasn't nearly as amusing the second time around, both because the shock of hearing uncensored bigotry on cable was gone and because of something my friend noted at the end of the first viewing: Lampanelli says that it's fun for us all to make fun of ourselves... but you'll notice she really only makes fun of minorities. Very little time is spent dissing white people -- I recall a few minutes about p.c. soccer moms and racist old white guys, the latter being just another excuse for black jokes. But, really, how could she insult whites to the same extent as blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Arabs or gays? There simply aren't equivalent stereotypes, evincing the same contempt and desire to wound, for Euro-Americans. The best she can do is to make fun of her sexually-motivated preference for dating black guys, which itself becomes an indirect degradation of black men and their supposed sexual assets.<br /><br />It's problematic."

"24314_0.txt",236,"This show is the epitome of what I avoid by watching adult swim original shows rather than more mainstream comedy; predictable pop culture laden crap. The skits often follow a dull formula, a parody of some TV show movie or toy with some kind of violent sexual or poop related joke carelessly thrown in, that plays out like a claymation family guy joke. The bits are generally a a poorly executed carbon copy of the source material, but with the aforementioned stupidly obvious joke thrown in. And when the creators are brave enough to stop suckling on pop cultures nurturing teat for a few seconds, we often are left a 5 (or less) second clip of something so creatively dull and brain dead the only plausible reaction is that of total silence. I say often because there are sparse moments of amusement, but these are too rare to make the show worth watching. The show is and exercise in poor writing and voice acting, and mediocre animation. The visual style of the show is unique, but not really smooth in any sense of the word, often seeming crude and rough. I do like claymation when its done right, and there's none of that here. What irks me above all is the show's immense popularity and the fact that it is constantly on adult swim's weekday lineup while worthy, innovative, dynamic and unique shows are forced aside.

"42002_0.txt",246,"The Last Confederate is a dull, uninspiring spin off of the Robert Adams story. Nothing in this movie impressed me. The acting was atrocious. There was not one believable character in the film. It just didn't seem authentic and the cinematography was amateur at best. It reminded me of a late night movie that would come on the lifetime channel. The production values are low and there is hardly any action . If you are expecting a hardcore war movie, look elsewhere because this feels more like a lousy romance novel. After watching Seraphim Falls with Pierce Bronson, a hardboiled western set after the civil war, you can tell the difference in the quality of direction and writing, and it was just so much more fast paced. Leave this one on the shelf."
"3409_0.txt",247,"We rented this movie because my 5 year old daughter liked the DVD cover featuring a ""girl with the arrow"". She had trouble following the storyline on her own - but I watched the movie with her and answered her questions. With the combination of a female heroin and lots of action, she really enjoyed the movie. Her 10 year old brother (who loves more advanced movies such as ""Lord of the Rings"") also enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />It's exactly what I expect from a Disney movie - interesting characters, lots of action and a simple plot line. <br /><br />A good family movie."
"21466_0.txt",248,"Joan Crawford is ""Harriet Craig,"" a manipulative, insecure woman who has to control everything around her in this 1950 film also starring Wendell Corey, K.T. Stevens, Lucile Watson, Allyn Joslyn and Viola Roche.<br /><br />The director, Vincent Sherman, knew how to get a good performance out of Crawford and did so several times, in ""Goodbye, My Fancy"" and ""The Damned Don't Cry."" He described her as a very bright, knowledgeable woman when it came to every aspect of filming. Here, Crawford is a cold, manipulative bitch married to hapless Walter (Corey), and as is implied, the sex is great. Pretty soon, he forgets that he's uncomfortable in his own house and that Harriet has isolated him from his friends and things he used to enjoy, and also that she can't have children - so she says. Harriet is unfortunately stuck with the old Craig family housekeeper, Mrs. Howard, who continues to be a burr in her saddle. Mrs. Howard sees through Harriet, as does his boss' wife (Watson). She recommends a promotion which will require Walter to spend some time away from dear Harriet in China. When Harriet finds out, she has a fit and makes sure the boss decides against sending him. Wouldn't want Walter gambling away the company money while drunk, now, would we? Harriet's niece Clare (Stevens) is made to feel extremely grateful by Harriet, so she works for Harriet for free. When Harriet finds out a worker at Walter's lab is interested in Clare, she tells Clare he's a womanizer who brags about it. Harriet is a piece of work.<br /><br />The saddest part of all of this is that I know someone like Harriet and believe me, this portrait is only slightly exaggerated! They are sad cases. They make the lives of everyone around them miserable. And they aren't happy people.<br /><br />Crawford is great in the role and has been said, she plays this type of part very well. She has the regal looks, the voice, and the requisite chilly delivery. For those who say this was the real Crawford, no one knows for sure. I don't think anyone deals with the woman herself at this point, only a plastic persona. She had to have been a lot more charming than Harriet and also, unlike Harriet, capable of letting down her hair once in a while and having a good time. Crawford the actress had many more sides to her than the ""Queen Bee"" and ""Harriet Craig"" persona. I think she was at her best in ""A Woman's Face"" and ""Possessed"" (the second one) which show what she could really do. I never felt she was great in comedy, but she was a hard worker who could do drama well.<br /><br />Wendell Corey does a good job as a man who loves his wife, his work and his friends and has to walk a thin line. The rest of the cast is uniformly very good, and the Craig house is gorgeous, if you like living in a museum. I'm really talking about the layout.<br /><br />As a spoiler, I think it would have been a riot if, after what we see in the film, Walter ended up with the widow next door. Who knows? Maybe he did."
"9935_0.txt",249,"Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day. I believe it actually lowered my intelligence. The funny thing is, the main character rambles on as if he is supposed to be intelligent with a bunch of 50 cent words at best...and funny enough the only reason i rented this movie was the fact that the box description claimed a dog<which looked a little like the taco bell dog with a mohawk with an african american accent> actually talked, and told him things to do...well the dog never physically talks, it just talks TELEKENETICALLY...i would tell you more..but half way through the film my eyes began to close as well did my fiances...so at least this movie serves as a sleep aid...That sadly however is its only purpose. Please dont do like i normally do and rent the movie despite the bad review, when i say this movie sucks worse then having a dog p*ss on the leg of your best dress slacks...i mean it!!"
"9453_0.txt",250,"This movie heralded the ""introduction"" of bona fide Australian adonis Antony Hamilton, though he had done television and a low budget cult film, ""Nocturna"" previously. Hamilton in various stages of undress is the only reason to watch this film -- which is a good enough one -- though in the version I saw some of the body parts were vaselined out. The dialogue is 20th century American dreck; Victor Mature, the movie star Samson, gives an embarrassing performance eating a chicken leg; and Belinda Bauer is no Hedy Lamarr and let's face it, Hedy Lamarr was not the most exciting actress to hit the screen, even if she was one of the most beautiful. This movie concentrates on bodies making out in the pool, a near-naked Samson getting tossed into the lake by his buddies, love-making between nearly naked Samson and nearly naked Delilah and good looks at Samson's muscles throughout. As far as I'm concerned, this is a no miss, having nothing whatsoever to do with the story. It is depressing, however, to realize that Hamilton died at such a young age and, all kidding aside, that is a very sad loss."
"22823_0.txt",251,"Most movie goers who have bothered to rate this, express their chronic dislike of this work due to Howie Mandell's presence herein; however, I must say that he is no more a harbinger of death to this film than anyone else.<br /><br />The performances found within this film are all adequate, with some better than others, but none were lacking such as to lessen the worth of this production. The dialog delivery was also adequate, but the dialog itself was trite, contrived, and slapstick in its execution. Mandell suffers more from poor direction than a lack of talent. Yes, he was an annoying element of his hey day, but he never outright bombed until this work. Christopher Lloyd is better than adequate, but his usual curmudgeonly charm is lost here. Cloris Leachman's performance is the only contributing factor which elevates this work, but she could not save it, alone.<br /><br />The story had a good basis which could have netted a great film, but the National Lampoonesque take on the whole premise is the leading contributing factor to this film's demise. The story was watered down and sentimentalized to the point of generating schlock instead of entertainment. There isn't one aspect herein which isn't contrived to suit the story line, including the domestication of the lead character and the time line wherein said domestication takes place.<br /><br />A young boy is abandoned by his bratling brother and left alone in the wilderness to be raised by wolves. After his rescue, his brother (still a brat) decides Bobo must learn to read and write...immediately! Intrigue ensues.<br /><br />Had this been treated with more care and a bit more seriously in the right places, this could have been a great comedy, but as is, this one fails on all levels: It does not teach, it does not ponder, and it does not entertain. As it stands, this work does show some serious moments, but they are in the wrong places; the timing is all wrong, and even those with no sense of cinematic timing can feel that the pace is out of step.<br /><br />All in all? This is nothing but sentimental, contrived schlock, which fails on all levels...though it DOES have heart.<br /><br />It rates a 3.8/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."
"12339_0.txt",252,"3 Walls: 7 out of 10: My first reaction was that Indian prisons are really nice. Honestly I went to a couple of sleep away camps in my youth and suffered more hardships than these prisoners. Sure the prison has sexual assault, loss of freedom and death but I am definitely sticking to my analogy.<br /><br />This is my first real Bollywood film and since there are no musical numbers or dancing or romance I am under the impression that the film isn't typical. This is straight forward human drama with very good dialogue and a surprisingly twisted and adult story.<br /><br />The film concerns three prisoners who are scheduled to hang. One is angry and proclaims his innocence, one refuses to accept guilt for his crime and the last is so racked with guilt he cannot wait for the noose to be drawn. Into their lives comes a female filmmaker with some baggage of her own.<br /><br />The movie is about the four characters interactions and how justice is eventually done despite long odds and corruption. While you may have some Shawshank Redemption flashbacks during the film the movie really has its own story and feel. The acting is good across the board and the production values are excellent. This would be a well made film in any nation."

A film in the same vein as Sleepless in Seattle to which this movie pays homage. Kate Hudson is simply great and more beautiful than ever. Matthew McConaughey really surprised me because he has played this role before without conviction. Also, it was fun watching both Bebe Neuwirth and Mr. ""Sun Spit Morning"" himself Robert Klein in their small but important ""boss"" roles. This wonderful chick flick (for chicks who love movies and guys who love chicks) is a real keeper."
"11522_0.txt",254,"I generally avoid films about politics, because I find that most of them are stereotypical and one-sided, but this one is directed by Gulzar so it can be nothing but excellent. I followed this belief of mine, and I was not disappointed. Aandhi is not at all a film about politics. Politics is just a part of the story, it's just a profession of a woman in this film, which is used to show her power and to show how a profession of this kind may trouble a woman's personal life. This is a film about love, marriage, romance, human nature, pride, separation, ego, forgiveness and reconciliation (in chronological order).<br /><br />Aandhi is about Aarti, a woman of strong character who has ambitions to become a politician like her dad. She falls for a common hotel manager named JK, and decides to tie the knot with him, much to the displeasure of her father. After marriage, Aarti tries her best to balance between her political work and responsibility as a wife/mother. However, as time goes by JK feels he becomes inferior to her even at home. Differences lead to intense arguments and subsequently to a break up. Many years later they meet again when she is already a big political leader. And a new relationship begins as they reminisce their life together.<br /><br />I was completely engaged by Gulzar's superb direction, his extraordinary story-telling, and his realistic portrayal of human relationships. We see neither bitterness nor anger between Aarti and JK, but only a renewed and mature relationship based on understanding and fond memories. The film is extremely well-written, so are the characters. The story unfolds interestingly through flashbacks and the connection between the past and the present is brilliantly displayed in the film. There is a very impressive attention the director pays to details. Gulzar's dialogues are exceptional, and he writes beautiful lyrics to the songs.<br /><br />Suchitra Sen and Sanjeev Kumar give two powerful performances. Sen is astonishing as Aarti. We see so many sides of her personality, and this difficult role is played with complete ease and precision by this phenomenal actress, including dialogue delivery and body language. This is a performance with a great mix of toughness and vulnerability. Sen displays both coolness and a pinch of arrogance while playing the strong politician, yet convincingly switches it with warmth and cordiality when she becomes a suffering woman or a wife. The ever-great Sanjeev Kumar is (unsurprisingly) nothing short of excellent. This is another outstanding performance this unforgettable actor added to his vast repertoire.<br /><br />The film is both a drama and a romance, and one aspect that significantly contributes to this is RD Bruman's fantastic soundtrack. ""Is Mod Pe Jaate Hain"", ""Tum Aa Gaye Ho"" are wonderful songs, but the one that makes the greatest impact is ""Tere Bina Zindagi Se Joi"", for its melodious tunes, fantastic lyrics, but most importantly for the amazing scenes it carries. I consider the sequences shown through this song the best scenes of the film. They show moments of interaction and painful feelings of missing. These are poignant and memorable moments, and the same can be said about the film itself. Aandhi is a gem. That's it."
"2360_0.txt",255,"The Tall Man returns with the original Phantasm cast for Phantasm IV: Oblivion. The fourth and supposedly final chapter in the Phantasm series takes off were Lord Of The Dead (Phantasm III) left off. In this one Reggie continues after Mike as Mike learns about The Tall Man's history. The kid from part 3 who knew everything about guns and fighting is dropped and Rocky who left in the car at the end of part 3 is also out of the picture. This leaves Reggie alone in search of Mike. As the Tall Man's history unfolds in a series of scene's from the original Phantasm, a majority of these scene's were cut from the original release of Phantasm and are being scene for the first time, other scene's are just scene's created specifically for this film. We learn about the Tall Man's history and even what his name is. In the end Reggie and Mike meet up for an unusual ending which leaves the viewer to figure out the rest. The first time I watched this I hated it, the second time I loved it, I don't know why, and now every time I watch it I love it, I guess the first time I just didn't like it. Phantasm 2012 A.D. is a possible release for yet another Phantasm film. ***1/2 out of **** it is a great film for die-hard fans like me, but on the other hand if your just sitting down to watch this you may be extremely confused. Thumbs up again to all the actors who have done an extremely well job with the acting in the series and hopefully will continue to do so in other movies or in the next Phantasm movie. Angus Scrimm did an amazing job playing 2 characters (a ""nice tall man"" and an ""evil tall man""). Make sure you've seen the other 3 before this one, it should help a lot."
"28832_0.txt",256,"Jacques Audiard, who previously gave us the very interesting Read My Lips (2001) and the cute and clever Venus Beauty Institute (1999), manages to create here a story about a character who is both a petty gangster and a pianist. Not exactly your usual combination of talents. Romain Duris plays Thomas Seyr who is that character. Duris brings an animal sensuality and an artist's sensitivity to the part. He is an actor of unusual skills and vitality. Audiard gets the most out of him.<br /><br />In the beginning Tom Seyr is in apprenticeship to take over his father's way of life in a French version of the protection racket. Their particular hustle involves getting properties condemned by trashing them or infecting them with rats or some other vermin, forcibly throwing out squatters or tenants, then buying the property on the cheap, and then finally selling it at a nice profit. In the end, Tom...well, I can't give you the ending, but I can say that it is entirely agreeable and surprising with just a little twist on what we might expect.<br /><br />Neils Arestrup plays the father. There are some other interesting characters and a lot of macho action, a bit of blood here and there, some quick and easy sex. And then there is an old piano teacher that Tom happens to run into one day who invites him to an audition. Tom has not played the piano seriously for years, but just seeing his old teacher brings back the thrill and the deep intimacy he once had with music, and recalls to him the career of his deceased mother, who was once a concert pianist who had hoped that her son would be too. He had the talent.<br /><br />But of course playing the piano at that level is not something you can take up, let go, and then go back to. But Tom thinks maybe he can do it with a little practice. But he needs a teacher to prepare for the audition. When he tries to get one he is effectively laughed at since he is 28-years-old and is very much out of practice and indeed never really practiced that much. But by chance (there are a number of plot furtherances in this film that come about by chance--but that is not a problem because the chance meetings seem natural and are events that would probably happen eventually)--and so by chance he is hooked up with a young woman fresh from China who speaks no French, but is an expert pianist who needs a little money. She agrees to help him. Her name is Miao Lin. She is played brilliantly with subtlety and finesse by French-Vietnamese actress Linh Dan Pham, whom I previously saw in Indochine (1992) playing the adopted child of Catherine Deneuve's character.<br /><br />The acting ability of Romain Duris and Linh Dan Pham are what carry this film. Audiard's direction is a bit scattered at times and especially in the beginning lacks focus, but a clever storyline and his ability to get great performances from the players overcome these faults.<br /><br />See this for Romain Duris who gives a virtuoso performance and for Linh Dan Pham who captivates with restrained intensity."

This terrific Oscar winning actress (1944 for National Velvet, in a supporting role) played just about everyone's mom in Hollywood during the 1940s. ""Mom"" to Gregory Peck in ""Gentleman's Agreement,"" Linda Darnell's mother in ""Forever Amber,""Montgomery Clift's mom in ""A Place in the Sun"" and Jennifer Jones'mother in ""The Song of Bernadette."" To me, Miss Revere, who was a descendant from Paul Revere, delivers a memorable line in the movie. To paraphrase, she states: ""I want you to be respected. I want you to be a teacher."" Sure, in 1947, the teaching profession was looked up to-to use a pun, it was revered. <br /><br />Unfortunately, this great line has been overshadowed by the line, ""Everybody dies.""

"26347_0.txt",258,"Lost In A Harem is one of the best Abbott & Costello films for 3 reasons: One, unlike most of their films in the 1940s which were produced at Universal Studios (and available on DVD in a Universal set), this one was done at MGM with that studios usual higher production standards, including a few spectacular musical numbers. Two, it is one of only about a dozen filmed appearances of big band great Jimmmy Dorsey, who performs, with his band, a number called John Silver (""15 men on a dead man's chest"") which I haven't found elsewhere, and a few other songs. Three, the ""Pokomoko"" routine (""Slowwwwly I turned, step by step I crept upon him . . ."") is done to perfection by A&C with Murray Leonard as the Derelict, which I've always remembered as one of my favorite A&C routines since I was ten years old. Furthermore, there's a real live giant (Lock Martin), full costumes and exotic sets as you would expect from MGM, a magic skit by A&C, hypnotism, a fine performance from Douglas Dumbrille as the bad guy, and more good music. I would rate it below Abott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, In The Navy, In Society, The Naughty Nineties, and perhaps 3 or 4 others, but definitely in their top ten or twelve. But since it's not in the Universal set, it's not available on DVD anywhere."
"8844_0.txt",259,"I love all three of these women, they are stunning actresses, just beyond beautiful. But this series has no story anyone could possibly want to watch. Their lives have no more relation to the real world than fairy tales do. It is not just that frequent contrivances jar the viewer, it is that every aspect of their lives and every situation they face is contrived. This show cannot replicate the success of Sex in the City because part of what made that series work was its originality, and you can't repeat originality.<br /><br />The show makes the mistake of carrying over Sex and the City's obsession with wealth and fame, but taking it up several notches. What the producers missed is that this obsession was never one of S&C's draws; it was not the reason people tuned in. Every time some new boyfriend on S&C was described at the most famous blabla or the leading blabla or the most powerful blabla in the widget industry the show lost its footing, but for the obliviousness of its audience of American women who cannot discern logic from nonsense.<br /><br />In LJ, it is not only the boyfriends of the week who are plutonian overlords, it is the women themselves. I have no objection to a story about the most wealthy, powerful women on earth, but I don't think such a story can work as a series. I don't think you can do an entire series about them, and you can't put them in those roles and still try to make them just nice, hard-working underdogs just trying to get by."
"17240_0.txt",260,"After viewing all six episodes of ""The Corner"" I sincerely believe that this extraordinary mini-series could've been a great film. I can see this film challenging the majority of so called masterpiece films in the theater right now, probably putting most of those films to shame.<br /><br />This film has everything I expect from masterpiece film-story telling. First of all, unlike a lot of the films made by African-American filmmakers, it doesn't hold back on the truth. Charles S. Dutton did a marvelous job of telling a story about real life in inner cities all across America and with out holding back on the truth. The film consists of stereotypes most African-Americans, especially those who are living safely in Hollywood away from the ghetto, want deny being reality in most Black communities. But this film doesn't apologize for the stereotypes or anything, while some of the characters are apologetic about many things in their own lives. Secondly, the acting was one of the best by an ensemble African-American cast in recent years. Thirdly, the film was shot well, using little style to the shots so that it would have that documentary feel. I also found each scene in the film to be well written, like some great scripts of the past like Good Will Hunting and the Deer Hunter, both great films. So we've seen films about the inner city before (Boyz N'the Hood, Menace II Society) this one. Who cares? Hollywood had made dozens of titles dealing with the mafia, and most of those films are great. However, this film stands alone from the rest, making viewers sympathize with and see each character as being exactly who they are: human beings that make mistakes. This film doesn't demonize the drug addicts in the film regardless of their sometimes immoral ways of getting that drug. ""The Corner"" ranks amongst one of the best mini series ever made for television. Despite the fact that it wasn't a feature film, I still rank it over the majority of films of recent years as well.<br /><br />If you had never been to the ghetto and you want to grasp an understanding of how must people in the inner city lives, this mini series is what you should see. Out of a grade of an A+, which is super excellent, to a F, I give this film an A+. I also give it 10 stars..."

The comedy genius of Leo McCarey (who did some fine comedies with the Marx Brothers) is involved & the film is well done. <br /><br />The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then. Back when we had morals in society, a man & a woman alone on an island for 7 years that were not married to each other was a big scandal. Now, with single women having kids without fathers, some having multiple kids with multiple fathers & with an anything goes types of morals involving girl & girls the plot in this seems to innocent. In the early 1960's this one was remade with Doris Day & James Garner (after Marilyn Monroe died tragically during her filming of it).<br /><br />If you want to see a fine talented cast making a fine film, this one is for you.

Was this an attempt to quadruple the laughs? If so, he failed miserably.<br /><br />I was thinking about a great teenage comedy film from the late '70s/early'80s - ""My Bodyguard"" which carried a similar theme of a young, loser kid trying to find his place in the world. That film not only appeared a million times more real but it also limited the ""quirky"" quotient to one character -- Ruth Gordon.<br /><br />C'mon Hollywood, stop cannibalizing yourself. Let's see something new..."
"28572_0.txt",273,"The Italian industry from the 50's to the late 70's thrived by imitating big Hollywood box office hits and even though The Inglorious Bastards came a good 10 years after the WWII action cycle of the 60's, it's still a welcome addition to the genre. Two years after his spaghetti western masterpiece Keoma, director Enzo G. Castellari gathers a cast of b-movie stalwarts spearheaded by Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson, a couple hundred disposable extras in Nazi uniforms and unleashes hell.<br /><br />There's no sophistication or Spielberg-ian schmaltz here. It's an action-er through and through with a comedic touch and lots of gunplay. Castellari is no hack though and you can see flashes of his directorial brilliance in the slow-motion intercutting shots in the train, which rival anything Sam Peckinpah has done with the same technique. He knows he's not doing Citizen Kane though so he doesn't let his ""artistry"" get in the way of making an entertaining picture. Not a masterpiece by any means and it will probably seem outdated to anyone used to modern CGI work and Matrix stunts. This is old school action.<br /><br />Tarantino is preparing a remake of sorts for 2009 but The Inglorious Bastards has enough going for it to warrant a watch not just so you can brag to your friends on opening day that you've seen the original. Action fans will get a kick out of it."

If that`s the case then why does the opening caption read "" Somewhere in France , All saints day , 1944 "" Couldn`t the caption have given the exact location ? , or would that lead people to research the integrity of this true story ? Since reading about the truth in "" true stories "" like PAPILLON and SLEEPERS alarm bells always ring in my head when the words "" true "" and "" story "" appear side by side , and if the story is in fact true ask yourself this question : If the events on screen actually happened then why isn`t the case better known . I mean if chairs were running around putting the boot into teachers wouldn`t that be front page news .<br /><br />My second criticism is that I thought this was going to be a bit more light hearted . Of course as soon as the waffen SS turned up and got some bayonet practice in I realised this wasn`t going to be the case , but by then the damage had been done and I knew not to expect any intentional laughs<br /><br />POSSESSED isn`t of much interest except for one aspect - How things used to be . For example smoking wasn`t the social crime it is now , only white people were allowed to be catholics , commies existed and wanted to drop atomic bombs on the USA , young teenage boys could be looked after by priests without any suspicion and teenagers swearing was a certain sign that there were demonic forces at work .

"7241_0.txt",275,"This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen. So what if the special effects aren't that great, or if the origin doesn't stick to the comics. Nicholas Hammond does really well as the wall-crawler. The rest of the cast does good too. The fights are awesome and so are the stunts. This is definitely a must see for any Spidey fan, like me. I give this film a 10 out of 10."
"14070_0.txt",276,"Once again, Jimmy Cagney struts his stuff.....and makes a big name for himself in the very early part of his acting career. He clearly demonstrates that he is a man who take over any scene and dominate it, and the film.<br /><br />Hollywood found this out in making this film. It is said that Cagney's role was originally much smaller in here but he was so good the script was changed to give him the starring spot....and his career took off from there.<br /><br />Speaking of billing and stardom, Jean Harlow gets second billing in this film but really has only a bit part; Blondell gets fourth billing has only a few lines.<br /><br />The story is a fast-mover and the movie is over in less than an hour-and-a-half. The cinematography in here is excellent and DVD really brings that out.<br /><br />The famous ""grapefruit scene"" with Cagney shoving the fruit in Mae Clark's face wasn't that big a deal back then and the scene happens so fast you almost miss it.<br /><br />For me, a highlight of the show was simply the facial expressions on Cagney. At the end of the movie, as he stands in the pouring rain getting ready to go in and kill people, his expression is downright scary - a very powerful scene.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is memorable, too. In all the film may be dated but it still very, very watchable and one of the great crime movies of all time."

"3124_0.txt",278,"The one thing that I will never understand how he does it, but Seinfeld manages to find the little things that almost all of us notice, but never give much thought to. He picks out the smallest things that we may think about a few times, or all the time, and manages to make it a big deal. He is a genius at finding the little things and making them into comedy bits.<br /><br />I'm Telling You for the Last Time is basically Jerry Seinfeld's final performance of the classic and loved jokes from the sitcom. After this he would never tell them again. All of the jokes are still funny, most of them are nearly identical, although on some he adds more, or does it with different emphasis, but that is expected.<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is that the jokes are familiar, but they are suppose to be. Even though I knew every joke, they were still great. Pharmasists, old people, horses, medication, bathrooms, airplanes, everything you can compound into a random thought was on here (figuratively) So to keep it simple, if you like Seinfeld, and are a fan of the sitcom, watch this and laugh again and again at his jokes."

Anyone who is aware of this Aussie film will know that it was banned by the censors for a long time. It's a pity, in many ways, that the censors eventually relented, as depriving viewers of catching up with this dross would have been something of a bonus. In reality, it has very little in its favour. Okay, it may well be the first Australian horror movie, and a pre-runner of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it doesn't take very long to become monotonous and downright irritating. The actors couldn't have been too concerned about learning their lines, as there simply arn't any. It's probably the horror equivalent of ""The Plank""!! Put simply, this is a total waste of time."

But now he faces a new threat in the shape of Romandy (Peter Cavanaugh) a small time gangster's son who wants to take over the casino. When the family refuse to hand it over, Romady turns nasty and Randell is left to take his adopted sister and his lover on a wild journey across the mean streets of Hong Kong in a desperate struggle to stay one step ahead of danger.<br /><br />In the very early 80s, a little while before Schwarzenegger/Stallone and a good while before Seagal/Van Damme, Chuck Norris enjoyed a period where he was pretty much the number one name in action movies. But they stuck to a pretty repetitive formula and one movie was pretty interchangeable from the other. This would be one such movie, only, as other reviewers have noted, with an even more wooden performance from the lead star. But there's some good kung fu action on display, an appropriately drawn theme tune and a pretty neat revenge theme running through it, so it's one of his better ones. ***"
"45386_0.txt",281,"This is probably one of the most pathetic action flicks I've seen. I rarely hit fast forward even on the most sorry acting endeavors, but this just brought tears to my eyes. Columbo should never do another film, his pouty face and supposed sadness over the death of his father is a hilarious ""gem"" to watch. I've seen high school plays with more drama than this. Baldwin, at least seems to be laughing at himself in his role which makes it easier to see him as the lothario that his family is famed for. Let's see what else, plot....um yeah....don't even bother listening it will save you from having to make up alternate scenarios in your head. I mean who wrote this script!! I'm angry at even having rented and spent time watching it. The ancient warriors were wholly unnecessary and take up literally about 8 minutes of the entire movie. It's not scary, not thrilling and I found myself wanting to grab a pistol to shoot my screen to get the violence moving. You have been warned!!"

The only reason I gave it even two stars is that it has some intriguing scenes with FFM, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />To begin with, the first few scenes appear to have been grafted on to the rest of the film. Why is everybody doing a Broadway show around the transport craft? (And shouldn't they get out of there when the airlock is opened to launch the ship?) Why does HK off his buddy and take his place? Hey, don't you think you ought to fasten your cargo down with straps or something before you zoom off and become weightless? <br /><br />After that, it gets really bad. KD and FFM are having a little May-December romance at the hydroponics research station, which is inexplicably unmanned except for them. (not that they actually do any research...they're too busy running around in lingerie, taking showers together, and flashing butts. And that's just KD.) Looks like a pretty sweet life to me...Earth is going to hell, but they just keep subsidizing this silly research station so KD and FFM can enjoy themselves.<br /><br />Then Satan comes...HK with his big buddy, Hector the Robot. Hector is one of the new demigod-series robots, but he looks more like a demitasse-series. He is a big old goofball. He's never even threatening.<br /><br />But that's enough of all this.

"17048_0.txt",284,"Unique variation on The Most Dangerous Game has quite the interesting twist..the prey is an attractive and NAKED stripper(..who becomes stuck in the position of dancing in front of bar slobs due to a run of bad luck). Reluctantly, she responds to the advice of a roommate, for a little extra cash, by getting in the car with a stranger she meets in her club, attempting to back out, but her choice of a pick-up was lousy..an expert hunter, who has graced the cover of magazines devoted to the sport, who likes to hunt down prostitutes on the side! When she attempts to escape from his jeep, he cold-cocks her, not long after, she finds herself in the middle of a wilderness buck naked. He, of course, is equipped with proper clothing attire, cross bow, and rifle. While, he has been successful as a predatory hunter(..he does have considerable advantages), this choice could be his undoing, for she's quite resourceful and strong.<br /><br />From the director of Sole Survivor and Night of the Comet, Thom Eberhart tackles to survivalist adventure genre and Naked Fear adds a certain spin never to be topped. Kudos should be heaped on Danielle De Luca who goes far beyond the call of duty, her character naked and bruised in the middle of New Mexico wilderness..certainly a breathtaking setting to have this naked girl running about. <br /><br />Not only does she deserve credit for baring everything for a large portion of the middle of the movie, but for her credible performance as a frightened victim who pushes herself to continue moving, despite her difficult circumstances. The role is incredibly demanding, and De Luca wasn't just some actress hired for how she looked in the buff. While spending a great deal of time, once her character awakens to find herself a quarry for the psychopath, running and hiding, trying to catch her breath at times, De Luca maintains our sympathy for her character's plight started from the very beginning and is established as a common occurrence in New Mexico..young, pretty girls snatched away from what they've known as a civilized world, flung into stripping and prostitution thanks to a series of events, call it fate if you wish, that landed them there. <br /><br />JD Garfield is Colin Mandel, the psychotic predator who is so hellbent on catching and killing Diana(De Luca), he even assassinates a father and his two boys whose presence he wouldn't allow to thwart his mission. Arron Shiver is Dwight Terry, a newly hired deputy, fleeing from a past that haunts him, who suspects Colin when he discovers that Diana is the latest girl missing, and evidence builds against him. Joe Mantegna adds some respectability to the movie as a cop, Tom Benike, who attempts to warn Dwight against going down the road of investigating his friend(..Tom and Colin are hunting buddies). <br /><br />Colin houses his victims' keepsakes in a tacklebox and we get a chance to witness his despicable antics as he pursues Diana, often bragging and grinning about his handiwork. He's such a loathsome scumbag, it doesn't take much to root for Diana to get the upper hand. <br /><br />The plot might ask a leap of faith from the viewer concerning the idea that Diana could actually overcome her dire / grim situation, gaining an eventual advantage, using cunning and whatever weapons she could get her hands on in order to fight back against her stalker, but that's all part of the fun. If you can make it through the opening act, which sets up the characters involved in the movie, it'll be worth the wait...I felt that the movie could've been trimmed a bit and still would've been effective. Admittedly, sometimes you become side-tracked ogling De Luca's body(..or, at least, I did) despite her harrowing ordeal, the action sequences and exhilarating location are assets that accompany the eye candy."

An intriguing storyline, engaging characters, and a phenomenal performance by Bill Henderson made this one movie I will be recommending to all of my friends. The director, Kevin Jordan, and many of his cast members were there, and he said the movie was made for about $40,000: you certainly can't tell that at all. This is a film about two brothers who are very different (played by real-life brothers) who both find love, but their love lives are complicated by outside circumstances. Bill Henderson plays the sentimental and lovable Uncle Clive (whom Jordan described as the ""Yoda of Love"" at the screening) whose memories of his own true love help Chris make decisions about his own life. This is a wonderful movie, but don't take my word for it: go see it for yourself."

It was a mistake to show it at all. Novelist William Boyd is a terrible film director and screenwriter who has no real grip on his subject. Instead of taking a fresh look at the run up to the battle, he uses every old cliché you've seen before in the lips of every old stereotype you've seen before. Most of the cast are so bad I've forgotten their names. Only Daniel Craig and Julian Rhind Tutt come out with any credit. Very badly photographed too, with the trench clearly an interior and far too clean. Just terrible. Channel 4 should have shown something like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, which hasn't been on telly in years."

The movie is set in the 80's and is a great nostalgic piece for that time period- in all is cheesiness and glory! Sandler as the Wedding Singer will surprise you with his musical talents. And musicians who have run the gamut of various music-related jobs will have extra giggles. And of course Barrymore will dazzle you with her cuteness and poise. This movie will leave you in stitches!

That made it particularly fun to watch again recently. Goldie's character is so beautifully understated. She is just one of us, going about her day, until her life changes. You can relate each step of the way. I loved how the camera caught pieces of the truth that she did not, slowly building suspense.

"13874_0.txt",292,"WICKED STEPMOTHER is the kind of movie that happens to an actor who cannot understand that his or her time has passed, and that encroaching illness and the approximation of death should be an indicative that maybe it would be best to relax and enjoy the accolades, retrospectives, and lifetime achievement awards.<br /><br />Bette Davis was coming off the mild success of THE WHALES OF AUGUST when she decided to do this movie about a witch who moves into a family's home and causes havoc there. Severely ill, barely able to remember her lines, and frail as a leaf about to fall from its branch in the middle of fall, she was forced to step out of filming only a week after production on the movie began.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, she claimed problems with the script among other things, making it clear that old age and illness had not mellowed her character one bit. What she seemed unable to understand that this sort of demands which she had been known for back in her prime was supremely out of style by now, and for an actress of her stature to assume she could throw her ego around just because, was pushing it a little.<br /><br />Hence, her scenes remain in this movie and should have probably been either deleted and replaced with another actress. I can only assume that the director did not have the money to replace Davis, and decided to keep her character and have Barbara Carrera step in, adding a ludicrous set-up that would explain Davis' absence from the movie. As it is, WICKED STEPMOTHER remains as Bette Davis' last film, one that can be bypassed as an gargantuan error on her behalf."

Its hard to view this movie 20-20 given the widely viewed subsequent series Happy Days which, while excellent, lacked the excitement and charm offered in the film. The soundtrack is wonderful and the Wolfman clearly demonstrates that a good voice can be hit you more directly than visuals given that you don't see it coming. I would have preferred it if Lucas has continued in this direction rather than become overly enamored with special effects in his subsequent films. Harrison Ford was fine as a young actor, although his acting skills did develop considerably in later years."

The sequence involving a pre-war socket and a modern tape recorder has me in fits of laughter.<br /><br />The finale, involving the three main characters singing in a talent show [ dressed as pig-tailed schoolgirls ] has tears rolling down my face and my face aching from laughter.

Is there any truth in the stories about murderous spirits that haunt the woods? Or is someone else responsible for their deaths?<br /><br />With nasty desaturated colours, irritating performances from most of the cast (who over-act in a desperate attempt to show the world what they are capable of), frequently fuzzy visuals (used to try and simulate being whacked out of your gourd on drugs), blatant cribs from other horror films (The Blair Witch project and many an Asian ghost film), and virtually no gore or gratuitous nudity, could this mess be any more annoying?<br /><br />Of course it could.<br /><br />Rather than tell a straightforward scary story, Breathnach unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind. In doing so, he confuses matters so much that the film ceases to be frightening.

I must preface my ""review"" by way of noting that I have only seen this movie once (at about age 8, with my parents, at the drive-in). For this memory alone I give the movie an extra point or two. I remember the plot and I remember the secretary mentioned in the previous commentary. I also remember, even as a young child, thinking the plot was really stupid. By no means would anyone consider this a really good movie but it is a really fun movie -- even if it wasn't intended to be funny. No spoilers here as one may consider the whole movie already spoiled.

The director had really no script in mind and comedy was really forced. I think Sajid Khan needs to see Bheja Fry to understand that by doing stupid actions and creating childish situation, you cannot make someone laugh (though there will be people who will enjoy it). Vidya Balan, Bomman Irani were a complete waste in the movie.<br /><br />This proves a point that if you are a star kid or from the industry it is easy to make a movie, get number of actors/actresses to do friendly appearances (which again was a waste) and boast on TV as if you are making the best movie ever seen. But Mr. director, please grow up and try to make a sensible comedy. Yes, we can still leave our mind at home to watch a movie but there should be some sense and element in your work.<br /><br />Overall this movie deserves 1 out of 10 star (some points deducted because of hyped expectation which it fails to meet).<br /><br />Thanks, Saurabh"

"11315_0.txt",302,"The movie makes the best out of a fairly unique story that is probably based on true historical facts. It is about a one day expedition to Amsterdam in May 1940, shortly before the arrival of the invading German troops. In a race against time exiled Dutch jewelers try to get all the industrial diamonds out of the country and bring them to Britain before the Germans can take them. It is a quick in and out operation organised by the British government that has to be accomplished in one day - and no easy task as the jewelers have to be convinced by sheer argument it is the right and sensible thing to do (hard to decide in the Netherlands in May 1940, I am certain).<br /><br />In a strange way this movie is surrealistic and realistic at the same time. There is a lot of good location shooting, the sun drenched streets of Amsterdam are virtually deserted, the atmosphere is ghostly. At times there is gunfire in the distance. There are some disoriented Dutch soldiers hanging around, or shall I say loitering? The effect is strangely threatening. At one time two groups of soldiers start shooting at each other. In another scene, one of the day trippers steps into a pub in a totally empty square. And there they are, the Dutch! Sitting peacefully behind their pints and discussing the latest news from the front. The transition really took me completely by surprise, it was incongruous but strangely effective and somehow totally believable.<br /><br />There are harrowing scenes. When the day trippers disembark, the harbour is in chaos and full of refugees  a strong contrast to the mentioned deserted streets in the town center. When they finally succeed in organising a meeting with all of Amsterdam's important jewelers, their Jewish colleagues express the opinion that for them it might be wiser not to make the Germans angry by giving away the jewels. They can be convinced to agree to the evacuation of the stones that are invaluable to the armament industry, although it is made perfectly clear that the day trippers can take no refugees with them. All these issues are treated in a rational and unemotional way which actually strengthens the impact of the tragic situation.<br /><br />In addition the movie also has some action scenes, a car chase and, as the culmination of the absurd general situation, the heist of a jewel depository by partisans who help the day trippers, with an ensuing fierce shootout with a detachment of Dutch troops. The acting is good, Peter Finch (Network) is cool as usual and gives a convincing performance as the son of an eminent Amsterdam jeweler and leader of the expedition. Eva Bartok is stylishly beautiful and enigmatic as a Dutch woman with uncertain alignments who joins the day trippers after they saved her from a suicide attempt (driving her car over the pier in the harbor, a car, incidentally, that comes in mighty handy). So, a hell of a lot goes on in Operation Amsterdam."
"28235_0.txt",303,"(Contains some Christian perspective. I sincerely have no intention to offend non-Christians and I'm really sorry if I would offend someone.) It was winter of 1961, a time when the streets of America was covered in a blanket of snow. On January 20 that year, a man who may have been the most popular president in the nation made his way on top of the platform. For the next fourteen minutes, he delivered an inaugural address that is still honored to this very day. At the end of that speech, he made this comment: ""Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country."" That president, was John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />I loved that line, until I realized that there's something more we can do to augment that passage. If I would rephrase that line today, I might as well say, ""Ask not what your country can do for you - neither ask what you can do for your country - but ask what you and your country, or better, you and the whole world, can do together."" Astroboy was a showcase for thinkers. As for me who has been dealing with morality for all I know, find this movie among the most amazing I've ever watched. Some may not care about slavery, power trip, or life's purpose... but I do... and it's my passion.<br /><br />I sat down the theater expecting little from this movie as people have given it negative remarks. Yet at the end of the show, I was perhaps the most ecstatic who walked out of the big screen.<br /><br />The animations were great. The voice actors? Just wow! And the sounds? Wonderful. These however, are less concerns for me. For what made me love Astroboy the way it is weren't these although they have obviously contributed somehow. What I loved about Astroboy is the philosophy tied to it mainly: Slavery, Power, and Purpose.<br /><br />On Slavery, One may not have to think too deep to see how humans in the movie treated the robots. Hasn't it been an issue that the world is trying to wrestle? the fact is that it was, and still is. To treat slaves as nothing more than mindless creation built for the service of the greater is to make a mockery of the sanctity of life. I can see it through the eyes of the makers because we have house-helps here... and I would say that sometimes, they weren't treated as they are supposed to be. We must never forget that any time we discriminate someone because of their race, social status, culture, economic status, or even gender, is an insult to humankind. I can see the robots here that portrays the feelings of the servants who are simply thrown out when they are no longer needed. There was a scene (SPOILER ALERT) in the movie where Astro had a conversation with one of the Robots in a sea of scrap metals called the Surface. ""This is what happens to us when they don't need us anymore,"" shares the robot, who looked like a mechanical zombie. This is saddening as I look at street children abandoned by their parents and old grandparents abandoned by those whom they once had taken care of. Perhaps, this could help us, not open our eyes, but more so, to lift our entire body for action.<br /><br />On Power, Albeit comically, this has done a great job in portraying the some presidents of the world today. As bad as it may sound, President Stone had been on his own trip for power, bypassing moral judgments with his own ambition to power... and even when his ratings plunges all time low, insisted on maintaining his throne through extra-constitutional means. I've once heard of the saying, ""power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" He who cannot handle power, deserves no right to hold it. The movie portrays what happens when a power monger goes on a power trip and those in position turns a blind eye. Again, this hopefully, can help us move one step forward in an action to keep the sanity of our leaders in check.<br /><br />On Life's Purpose, Astroboy definitely had a one liner that made me love the whole thing. (SPOILER ALERT) At the end of the movie, a monster suddenly appears that threatens the life of many. Astroboy looked at his dad and prepares to battle the villain. His father asked him, ""Son, are you sure you want to do this?"" Astroboy, without batting an eyelid, smiled at his dad saying, ""Yes dad, this is what I was made for."" and flies away.<br /><br />""This is what I was made for."" In regular terms, this doesn't mean a thing. For Christians, this means the whole world. Any Christian who's been serving in the ministry will tell you that those seven words mean so much. Ephesians 2:10 seems to sum it all up. It says, ""For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."" This is what we are made for. Let's not forget that God has planted a longing for every person to do the right thing because that's exactly what gives life its direction. Every time you do good, you move forward in life. This is what God has made us for. My friends, let us not forget our mission here. This is our purpose.<br /><br />___ <br /><br />Conclusion? I love it. I love Astroboy and if there's one movie that I wanna watch again, there's no doubt, this is the one. I've never made such an extensive review of a film. This just shows how much I loved it. People won't appreciate Astroboy if they are not action oriented and philosophically driven. But if you look for the things you can learn after seeing the movie, Astroboy is one thing you're gonna enjoy."
"10164_0.txt",304,"The final series, this time focusing on WWI. Part of what makes this one work so well is that they point out the negatives of war, especially the more traditional battles, so marvelously; the officers are devoid of a sense of reality beyond their comfy chair and desk, the assignments all contain the unwelcome promise of certain and meaningless death, boredom is rampant during a lot of the waiting, and the front runs out of supplies and the substitutions... you don't want to know(not sure why they felt the need to go into such detail about it, much less have so many of that type of jokes, but I digress). Melchett returns, as a stark raving mad superior, adopting the obnoxious, loud behavior of Laurie, and the two, individually or, better yet, together, lead to many an eye-rolling, funny and memorable moment. McInnerny is back, and going by his wish to avoid being typecast as the innocent, and remarkably stupid, Percy, he instead is cast as a slimy rival to Edmund, with the unbelievably(though based on an actual poor bugger) unfortunate surname of ""Darling"", creating an utterly hilarious running gag. This has a fantastic main group. The verbal, clever, British material is still going strong, immensely so, and this holds numerous of the greatest lines of the franchise. Satire is also magnificent in this, and it comments on more or less every aspect one could think of, relating to the period and situation. The plots are interesting, well-written(as really everything in this) well-thought out, and rather surprising. Acting is all great, and the guests are impeccable, including the always spot-on Richardson. Blackadder himself isn't downright depressing as he was in the third, which is not to say that the bite and snark that we do love so are gone, not by a long shot. Every episode is excellent, and the ending of the final one is beautiful. The comedic timing is flawless. There is silly stuff, in-between the wit. Almost all of it garners deserved laughs. I recommend this warmly to any fan of these shows, Atkinson and this type of humor. 8/10"
"40146_0.txt",305,"Becca appears to have it all: the hunky boyfriend who dotes on her (and Omigahd he proposed!); a chandelier-shattering voice that goes down well at the local bar; a great job teaching chill-drenn, validated by the 'Teacher of the Year' award; and an adoring family and friends. Should be enough for someone who's essentially a loud, large, brassy, not very pretty Jewish princess.<br /><br />But no - a skinny, classically good-looking blonde shiksa disses her looks, and so Becca has to beat her at one game she's utterly ill-equipped for: a beauty pageant.<br /><br />!Spoiler for anyone who didn't see it coming! Happily for her, the miracle of movie magic makes it all possible - ignoring any more realistic scenario in which a woman like her would be blown off in seconds for not adhering to Western beauty industry standards.<br /><br />This one's not like any of a number of other beauty contest films, in which an essentially spectacular girl has her light hidden under a bushel of bad clothes and glasses, to be revealed in time to win in the final reel. And that's because this film is fundamentally a wish-fulfilment fantasy for - pardon me - fat, ugly, spoilt girls who don't look like Sandra Bullock at her messiest. Its message is that external attractiveness doesn't count as much as 'inner beauty'. Of course, the convenient thing about the inner variety is that there's no agreed standard, so just about anyone can claim it and be believable.<br /><br />Our Becca has loads, of course, as she reveals constantly. The result is inevitable: hip, hip, hooray, the cute blonde is defeated (worse, she's converted), to the vicarious - not very beautiful - schadenfreude of the Becca-alikes in the audience.<br /><br />The depressing thing about all this is that of course inner beauty exists, and of course it really is ultimately more profound than the external kind. But to specifically pit inner beauty against good looks *in a good-looks contest* is silly, pointless, and smacks of vicarious spoilt greed. A rather ugly film.<br /><br />CD"

"41431_0.txt",307,"I left the cinema very happy and with a feeling of a still lingering fear and intense joy that perhaps could come close to what you feel, still running but just having escaped unharmed after three hours of torture by a sadistic lunatic. The film was over. Following this sentiment of immense relief, there came anger. I know my Lawrence well and I have read all of his books, and my first encounters with Lady Chatterley's Lover (the book) was strong, so I had been looking forward to this adaptation. And here was the worst film I had seen for a long time. I was angry, because I couldn't find a single thing in this adaptation that would explain why I had had to pay for this. Nothing. Even the actors were mediocre (if they ever spoke!), our dear homme de bois, was actually at times quite laughable (the audience did laugh when they certainly weren't supposed to). Why, why, why? Why make a film that is so murderously non interesting? Why is every theme that Lawrence touches upon in his book grounded down to a sloshy Harlequin devoid of all suspense? Why did anybody come up with the idea of financing this film, less acting in it? Did the director take money out of her own pocket, did she rob a bank? And what had the jury smoked before they decided on giving this film a César??? <br /><br />Or if this is the best of French films this year, then just how bad is a bad French film?"
"4071_0.txt",308,"With the exception of his little knock-off horror/comedy ""Hiruko The Goblin"", I have loved all films I've seen by Shinya Tsukamoto and this is probably one of his best. It takes a while to understand what's going on, but the build-up is quite good and is creepy, bordering on disturbing. A doctor and his wife are staying with his parents, and the parents are not sure about the new bride, who claims to have amnesia but may be other than what she seems. When the father passes away, there is much mourning, and then when the mother arises to use the bathroom in the middle of the night she encounters a VERY strange character that literally scares the life out of her. And then there's the kindly doctor who is puttering about the garden who suddenly is attacked and ends up at the bottom of the well, only to realize that it seems to be himself that put him there? For he has an identical twin, it seems, and the twin has assumed his identity. Sure, there's a lot more to it than that, but you'll have to watch it to find out. Good use of eerie and unsettling music too. This is a bit more ""arty"" than earlier Tsukamoto films, but well worth seeing and very unsettling. Ryo as the wife Rin is quite good in her role and she seems almost ""other-wordly"" and to an extent, she IS from another world, of sorts. Well worth seeing for fans of creepy Asian cinema and if you've seen and liked other offerings from Tsukamoto (like Tetsuo, Snake of June), you'll like this. 9 out of 10."

His music (especially from ""Tristan und Isolde"" and ""Parsifal"") appoints to the film its tragic and melancholy atmosphere.

Sobieski did a very good job too as it seems to me that she has a bright future ahead of her. The music was well placed but was fairly standard. The use of shadows was quite interesting as well.

"15601_0.txt",311,"When the movie going public demands you back 14 times you know that something is being done right by both the studio and the players involved.<br /><br />William Powell and Myrna Loy hit a real career high point in this film with a rather original plot gimmick. The amnesia gimmick is stood on its head in this film.<br /><br />Powell and Loy are married and he's on a business trip involving an ocean voyage. Powell is something of a stuffed shirt when we meet him on the ship. When a drunken Frank McHugh falls overboard, Powell dives in to rescue him and in the process gets himself knocked out.<br /><br />When he comes to, like in Random Harvest, he discovers his former identity which is that of a confidence man and as it turns out McHugh also is a full time grifter.<br /><br />Unlike Ronald Colman who spent the whole of Random Harvest searching for his lost years, Powell has his identity there. Returning to his town with his new found friend McHugh, he finds wife Loy together with the fact he's a person of some means. But he also finds out that Loy was planning to get rid of him.<br /><br />Powell together with McHugh and former associate Edmund Lowe try to work an elaborate con game on the town. At the same time Powell is falling for the woman he married and embarks on a campaign to win her back. Those two agenda items come into conflict. <br /><br />Bill and Myrna are at their best in I Love You Again. Two highlight scenes for me are Powell's cooing courtship of Loy and his trip through the woods in his Boy Ranger uniform with his Boy Ranger troop. This must have been the same outfit that Jimmy Stewart was trying to get a summer camp for in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The goings on are similar to what Powell went through fishing in Libeled Lady.<br /><br />I Love You Again is movie comedy at its very best. Don't miss it if TCM runs it again."

The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians. The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys). Also along for the ride are Dr. Bashir, the shape-shifting Constable Odo, the sneaky Ferengi Quark (who owns a bar on the station), the Trill Jadzia Dax (who knows Sisko from a previous body the Trill inhabited), and the newly promoted Chief O'Brien (from the TNG Enterprise) and his family.<br /><br />While Sikso and crew must bring the station up to speck, they start investigating an anomaly - one that will have far repercussions for this sector of the galaxy (including with the Cardassians - in the form of Gul Dukat).

"1400_0.txt",314,"The first, and arguably in terms of their dual performances, best teaming of Horror legends Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi is this almost bizarre Edgar G. Ulmer directed piece.

When the bus taking them to the hotel crashes and Joan is injured, the trio wind up at the home of Verdegast's old acquaintance Hjalmar Poelzig {Karloff}. Where the troubled history between Verdegast and Poelzig comes to light and thus spells immense danger for the newly married Allison's.<br /><br />Excellently directed by Ulmer, The Black Cat still today has the ability to genuinely unnerve the viewer. Filled with an overwhelming sense of dread throughout, Ulmer and his on form leading men have crafted a superb study of character evil. Flanked by a magnificent set design and with a script that does Poe proud, the piece pot boils until its brutal and frenzied climax. Karloff and Lugosi are particularly impressive {check out the chess match sequences}, lending the film its timeless quality, with Karloff's Poelzig apparently being based on real life occultist Aleister Crowley. While the music, featuring some of the biggest names of classical composition, is an extra haunting character all by itself. It's a far from flawless picture, but it remains a unique, literate and important film in the pantheon of classic horror. 7/10"

It was so unrealistic in a bad way, and the violence was inappropriate. ""Pet Sematary"" was a work of art by the master, Stephen King. ""Pet Sematary II"" was a work of trash by some wannabe. The acting was fine, but they couldn't save the movie if their lives depended on it. The nudity was in all the wrong places. The doctor has a fantasy about his dead wife, and her head turns into that of a barking dog. It was sick, disgusting, and way too many people died. Did you notice how there weren't very many deaths in ""Pet Sematary""? Well in ""II"", there were tons. Way too many. This movie was horrible.

It's quite obvious they were trying to do things on the cheap; which area they saved the most money on is not so obvious. The ""B-list"" celebrities for voices? Richard Simmons proves why he never succeeded as an actor. Eric Idle can't decide whether his character is from Liverpool or the Bronx. I truly believe Bob Newhart was disguising his voice so no one would realize he had stooped to this level. Whoopi Goldburg and John Goodman do their best to add some life to this worthless script and fail quite spectacularly.<br /><br />The music? It sounds as if it were written by a freshman music major - who is failing out of college. They had to bring a previously-released Paul McCartney tune to give the soundtrack some semblance of professionalism. The animation is difficult to look at, and I found some of the supposedly happy faces ""scary"" looking.<br /><br />We bought this in a pile of used movies for 99 cents. FREE wouldn't have been cheap enough for this waste of videotape.

"12883_0.txt",321,"I only caught part of this show (from the Major General's entrance) on a recent showing on Sky TV in the UK and it restored my faith that G&S can be adapted with sensitivity for new audiences. I thought Jon English turned in a superb performance as the Pirate King and the comic scenes were played for all they were worth without (mostly) becoming unfunny. Choregoraphy - especially with the police in the second act was first class. A couple of minor quibbles - not sure why it was necessary to bring in the trio from Ruddigore - it seems fashionable these days to ""cross-dress"" so to speak and although this actually worked quite well it wasn't really necessary. The Swinglettes as a take off of the Andrews Sisters was superb but unfortunately it also meant that Edith was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the daughters when she has a decent part in the original score. Minor points, though, you could hear the audience absolutely loving it and it kept far enough on the traditional side of the line without being stuffy - Gilbert may have shuffled uncomfortably in his grave but he would not, I think, have turned right over.

"48970_0.txt",322,"this movie has no redeeming qualities at all...none...it is insulting and worst of all it isn't funny.

When I saw the film it didn't draw one laugh from the audience that was watching it...not one. It was a pathetic, humorless, offensive and stupid endeavor.

One of the biggest problems I initially saw (aside from the horrible over-acting of Ray Milland and the dumb plot) was that despite the title, the film has very few frogs. Most of the killer animals were actually toads, lizards, tarantulas, snakes, birds and alligators. Aside from gators and a few of the snakes, which were poisonous, it just seemed ludicrous seeing these totally harmless creatures supposedly on a mad killing spree--though none of them actually did a whole lot other than just hop scamper about--after all, they are just cute little critters.<br /><br />Some of my favorite stupid deaths in the film was one where a guy seemed to be killed by Spanish moss and tarantulas. Aside from a few chigger bites, I can't see how Spanish moss could pose any health problem and a tarantula bite is about as bad as a bee sting! Another had a man killed by bottles of various poisons which cute little lizards pushed off the shelves in a nicely choreographed scene (though none of the reptiles were killed--they just scurried about the dead man's body). Another scene featured a man getting bitten and dying from a rattlesnake bite in less than 3 seconds. And my favorite was when the guy wrestled with a gator--and if you looked closely, you could see that the animal's jaws were taped shut! <br /><br />From my description, you'd probably assume this was a terrible film--and it is. However, like many of the animals running amok films of the 50s, 60s and 70s, it is also strangely watchable because it is so silly. Many won't enjoy this campy a film, but bad film lovers will have a ball. If you like this wretched 70s film, also try EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (which is actually worse than FROGS) and NIGHT OF THE LEPUS (about killer bunnies). Don't say I didn't warn you!"
"48641_0.txt",324,"In the first and most memorable scene in this movie, 'Jackson', while wearing a hockey mask and meandering around the streets of London one night, and grabs a guy from behind and peels back the flesh from his face and then punches a hole into the guy's chest and then rips out his heart. Then, in the first of several changes in tone, we get annoying attempts at humour, where Jackson tries on cowboy hats in a store while still wearing his hockey mask, a cornball sequence where they go for a stroll on the beach one evening at sunset, while Jackson is still wearing his hockey mask(!) - is this supposed to be a comedy or a soap opera love story now? The movie changes tone drastically (again) and we plod through over a half an hour of crap about him and his blind girlfriend and their relationship problems, with Jackson walking around their bedroom wearing a pair of red underwear with 'Bad Boy' printed on them. *groan* Then if I remember correctly, towards the end we get a couple more semi gory killings, before Jackson collapses crying and screaming ""No! No! No!"" after seeing a marquee at a local movie theatre which reads something to the effect of ""Coming soon: 'Unmasked part 26'"" hinting that he still will never be able to stop killing, no matter how much he may want to, because the producers will keep bringing him back again and again in more sequels.<br /><br />That joke about the marquee listing the title of the next supposed sequel being called 'Unmasked part 26' probably didn't make sense in the alternate version called 'Hand of Death' either, and it does make for a really anticlimactic (and abrupt) ending. This looks like home movies filmed on the streets in and around London on a pocket change budget in a few days time, while it might have had a valid point about the unoriginality of Hollywood, it was mostly brought down by the non existent budget and the dramatic changes in tone throughout the movie. It just ends up looking like a hybrid between horror, soap opera romance, and the kind of diffused look of a soft core porno video. It's one of the most memorable flicks you're ever going to see, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good.<br /><br />** out of ****"
"37238_0.txt",325,"Killer Crocs and Gator movies are a dime a dozen for every ""Alligator"" there is ""Lake Placid 2"". However the concept of a very violent and aggressive Crocodile movie gets me a tad excited. Unfortunately for Primeval more hopes were dashed as we get a tad to much comic relief and way to much political/civil war story and not enough Croc action.<br /><br />The story is about a news crew who are sent in to South Africa to capture a 25 foot long killer Croc dubbed ""Gustave"". Unfortunately for us the film-goer there is a civil war that has broken out which we are surrounded with for much to long of the stories running time. Be it the tribes in the area or the military men that are with them the movie just really wanted to hammer that fact home, with the Crocodile as the side story. We do get the Croc and when it was on screen it was a bad sucker unfortunately they opted for more CGI then you could shake a stick at but it was not of ""The Mummy/Mummy Returns"" crappiness so I guess we can let it slide to a point but would a prosthetic monster Croc be too much to ask for in some of the scenes as it would have been more effective.<br /><br />The shame here is that the whole myth and legend of this creature was very cool but ruined by the fact that we hardly see it for most of the running time. I believe total there is about 20 minutes at best of Croc action. The rest well you get the point. I highly recommend getting the original ""Alligator"" or the lesser known Austrailian Croc film ""Dark Age"" as they are more effective and you get to see what the movie intends for you to see...Croc and gator action.<br /><br />In the end this is a waste of time, it really is a ""just there"" movie with a few good Croc scenes (the cage scene comes to mind). If you have seen all the Croc movies and want to see another well have at it but for the average horror movie/ nature amok fan this one is just not that good.<br /><br />4/10: Below Average: A few Croc scenes that are good otherwise a lame excuse to shove info on South African civil war at us.....go figure?"
"4029_0.txt",326,"It's such a relief to see a film that's both set in Toronto and features Toronto as one of its principal stars. This hasn't really happened since 1970 when Don Shebib's landmark Canadian film ""Going Down the Road"" filled us with an extraordinary sense of pride in our Canadian culture. That's the first good thing about ""A Winter Tale.""<br /><br />The next good thing about this film is that Telefilm Canada, our federal cultural agency whose business is the development and promotion of the Canadian film industry, had the good sense to provide funding support to this small indie production. Telefilm decision makers could not have known, more than three years ago when the film was struggling to overcome all the barriers that make it so hard for independent Canadian films to see the light of day, that this little film would have the phenomenal success it has achieved  across Canada and in Great Britain, Europe, the United States and the Caribbean.<br /><br />The third good thing about ""A Winter Tale"" is the film itself. The fact that it looks, with empathy and thoughtfulness, at the violence and pain that has invaded culturally diverse neighborhoods in cities all over the world. And that it does so without the noisy, gory ""shoot 'em up"" theatrics of Hollywood's brightest and best. The fact that it explores (as much as any 100 minute film can) the inner lives of the men and women who are trapped within their day to day sorrows and joys. No matter what they do, they remain isolated by barriers of racism and poverty from the benefits and rewards that Western societies continue to promise their ever-hopeful immigrants. It is because of these features that audiences in countries all over the world believe that this little Canadian film, set in a downtown Toronto community, speaks directly to them and to their concerns and interests.<br /><br />The last, but by no means the least, good thing about this film is director Frances-Anne Solomon's idea to use it as a tool for community engagement. At as many screenings as possible, Solomon and some of her cast have invited the audience to stay around and ""Talk It Out"". Audiences, young and old, of every color, class, caste and creed, in Canada and elsewhere, have taken up this invitation eagerly and added their own real life stories to the poignancy of the movie experience. Thus,"" A Winter Tale"" has fulfilled much more, I am sure, that anybody ever expected.<br /><br />At one of the first screenings that I attended about a year ago, Solomon thanked Diane Boehm for CHUM TV's providing the original funding to get this project going nearly eight years ago. It always gives me hope to know that there are still Canadian executives who, like Diane Boehm, are prepared to take a chance on Canadian talent that is relatively unknown in our so-called ""mainstream"", simply because it is Canadian."
"44936_0.txt",327,"Donkey Punch has a very interesting (although fu*ked up) premise in which seven people have a party on a yacht out in the Mediterranean sea, only to have one of them try the infamous ""donkey punch"" during sex with one of the women...and accidentally kills her.<br /><br />Now, what they could have done with the paranoia between the surviving characters would have been interesting, but they degraded the plot even more from it's fu*ked up premise into a stupid slasher film. Not only that, but it's also hard to tell what's happening on screen for most of the time. Stupid and unbelievable situations continue to unravel themselves.<br /><br />But, I have to be honest. I actually liked the film up until the actual donkey punch. After that happened the film just got lazy. But, hey, it had some good music though."
"12792_0.txt",328,"Where do I even start with this movie...<br /><br />This is probably the goofiest film I've ever seen in my life. No... scratch that. This IS the goofiest film I've ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I've heard ""Hausu"" is a cult horror classic in Japan. Fine. I admit, I can see where it would be a cult classic just because it is so strange. And if you really legitimately like it, that's fine. But I saw this with a bunch of students at a university screening. Out of about 15 people, 3 walked out, 2 feel asleep, and the rest were either struggling to make sense of the crazy stuff they were watching or riffing on it the entire time. And what really bothers me is that in the post-screening discussion... even though no one could accurately explain or make sense of what they just watched... even though half the audience was making fun of it the entire time... even though it was an absolute goofy mess, NOT ONE PERSON SAID IT WAS BAD.<br /><br />Now, this may just be me, but I'm of the opinion that if you can't watch a movie without giving it the MST3K treatment, it's not a good movie. You may enjoy making fun of it... but that doesn't make it good. For example, ""Future War"" is terrible. But you can have fun watching the MST3K version because they make fun of how terrible it is. That doesn't make the movie good. It just means you can have fun making fun of it.<br /><br />Now, if you legitimately like ""Hausu,"" that's fine. But don't say it's a good movie if you thought it was a confusing mess, or if the only way you could sit through it was by riffing on it with your friends.<br /><br />I can't go into everything that bothered me about the movie so I won't even try. Every scene is packed with WTF laugh inducing moments.<br /><br />The plot... I think... is that this girl doesn't like her father's girlfriend and goes to her creepy aunt's house with her friends. The aunt is a vampire... or maybe she's a cat... no wait... maybe there is no aunt... no... wait... the cat is the aunt who sucks life out of people so she can inhabit a body... and somehow this results in a guy getting turned into bananas... oh and there's a watermelon salesman, who's a skeleton... who might be selling heads... or might be the aunt too... or the cat...<br /><br />CRAP!!! Let me start over. Okay, so there's this girl who's mad at her Dad. So she goes to her aunt's with some friends. And they are picked off one by one... for some reason... because the house is alive... no... wait... the house is the aunt... who's waiting for her husband... who's dead... or maybe HE's the watermelon salesman... but the watermelons are really heads... or maybe it was just that one... or maybe there is no watermelon...<br /><br />D***IT!!! I can't into any depth trying to explain the plot. These girls go to a house where they're picked off one by one in the most ridiculous ways imaginable. The girls are all annoying stereotypes who don't act like logical people.<br /><br />You see, if I found a skeleton in a closet, I would think, ""Hmm... maybe I should... GET THE F*** OUT OF HERE!!!"" When the girls see it, they just buy the aunt's crappy explanation. Something about a doctor using the house as a hospital or something. NO!!! SKELETONS SHOULD NOT BE IN CLOSETS!!! LEAVE!!! YOUR FRIENDS SHOULD NOT DISAPPEAR MYSTERIOUSLY!!! LEAVE!!! The only one who's even remotely tolerable is Kung Fu... because she's the only one who actually tries to fight what's happening to them.<br /><br />So, the characters are annoying and the plot makes no sense. Aside from that... there is no logical editing. There is no logical structure to what's happening. All of a sudden we cut to a really campy 70's humor montage of someone getting stuck in a bucket. All of a sudden, there's a bear eating noodles with his friends in the middle of the big climax. All of a sudden, someone is bananas. The music is weird. The action scenes are cut so that you can't tell what's going on. What does Kung Fu do? You can't tell. All you know is that she's apparently beating something up. The effects are weird. There are weird cartoon sequences. THIS MOVIE IS JUST WEIRD!!! <br /><br />So why is it a ""3"" and not a ""1""... I found some of the cartoon integration with the live action footage inventive. I like some of the editing, even though it is crazy. I did like some of the scenery and some of the imagery. I love the way the girls are done in by their stereotyped personality elements. And it is at least an interesting watch, even if it doesn't make any sense at all.<br /><br />OVERALL - This movie is goofy. It's a confusing mess. And the parts that aren't stereotypical horror clichés are absolutely insane. But what really bothered me was that people weren't willing to say it was bad in public, EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID SO IN PRIVATE. Again, if you really do like it... I'm not attacking you. I can see why this is a cult classic. But I didn't like it, and I know other people didn't like it, and I'm writing my review based on that.<br /><br />3/10 - It's a confusing mess with a few redeeming elements. Definitely recommend for MST3K Home Edition, or if you want to see something REALLY weird."
"5_0.txt",329,"Turner Classic Movies showed this silent, B&W flick today (Aug 29, 2007) on TV.<br /><br />Solid classic adventure story, complete with all of the key ingredients: exotic plot locations, a beautiful woman in peril, a pair of dauntless and resourceful heroes (one of them handsome, the other colorful) grossly outnumbered by badguys, sprinkled with comic relief. Great costumes and sets; as good or better than those of current movies. Surprising variety of camera craft and directorship; pans and zooms including overhead angles, and closeups of key characters and objects. In this regard again it seems like a modern movie! Actions convey the story very well; without the benefit of a soundtrack. Of course, this entails a considerable degree of live type acting (similar to that seen in plays), but I did not get a feeling of melodrama like is all too common in most silent films and early sound movies.<br /><br />The most enjoyable performance is played by Louis Wolheim as the rough edged but colorful Sgt. Peter O'Gaffney, who was *perfectly* casted for the role; considering both appearance and skill.<br /><br />There were at least a few peculiar facts about Muslim society that I had previously learned over the past several years, which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous, sword wielding Arabs through the narrow streets of a busy Muslim city. Suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it's time for afternoon prayer. Everyone out on the streets (except for the heroes) religiously obeys Islamic law and momentarily kneels down, which allows the heroes to escape. That scene was just one example of the film's many expressions of originality.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier."
"45656_0.txt",330,"By definition, I'd really refer to this as a shocker film rather than as a scary movie. This film prefers special effects and disturbing, bloody scenes to say suspense or good writing. The acting was sub-par at best, though I would say it may be Chris Kattan's best job yet. Average cut between shots has to be in the milli-seconds. The shot selection bounced so much I began having a headache. The only movie with more cuts was probably Domino. The ending was sub-par. The movie seemed to want to incorporate too many themes for one horror movie: killer husband/wife, haunted house, deranged surgeons, ancient evil, etc. The best part of the movie was that at very least they had the decency to set the tone early to let you know what was going to be coming at you. That being said, I did watch it all the way through, so it clearly wasn't as bad as it could have been."
"38258_0.txt",331,"Considering that this film was directed by the famed German director, Ernst Lubitsch, starred the great Emil Jannings AND it's title talks about Mummies, I was certain that I would love this film--especially since I love silent films. However, in this dreary film, you see none of the famed ""Lubitsch touch"", Jannings is just okay, the film is NOT about mummies at all and the print from Alpha Video was so fuzzy that it was a chore to watch the thing! The film is set in Egypt, though you really don't see any mummies. Instead, it's an odd tale about a weirdo (Jannings) who has kidnapped a lady (Pola Negri) and has kept her locked inside a temple. When she's rescued by a Brit, he's smitten with her and takes her back to the UK to live with him. She is worried, though, that the crazed Jannings will follow her and exact revenge. No mummies, no curse and not a whole lot of action or excitement.<br /><br />I wonder. With a different title and different people responsible for the film, I would have had lower expectations and therefore liked the movie more. But, as it was, it was a HUGE disappointment in practically every way.<br /><br />PS--I've seen quite a few films from Alpha Video. While some of their offerings are rare and hard to find, their DVDs are rather consistently of dubious quality and are rarely, if ever, restored. They are inexpensive, but they're also no bargain thanks to fuzzy or scratchy prints. If you can find other brands, you may want to try them first."
"41954_0.txt",332,"There's a reason most people don't know about this movie and that's because it's for film students and those who consider themselves in the hierarchy of the film community. Are people too in love with Tarkvosky to recognize this is a bad movie? Bad storytelling? It ""invents"" nothing. There are virtuous aspects; no doubt. We all know that they're technical. The acting, however, is misdirected. Great actors who have nothing interesting to say and walk around just speaking words. THey mean nothing. Tarkovsky's ""sculpting in time"" theory has not been closely followed for good reason: it makes for tedious, dull, and repetitive movies. His movies won't last."
"49325_0.txt",333,"First of all, let me say that I am just beginning to get my 'Italian Horror' cinema education so I'm still getting used to the unique aspects of the genre. This is my first Ruggero Deodato film (Next on my list to view is his 'Cannibal Holocaust' film). So far, vintage Italian horror has an obviously different tone indeed from vintage and especially new American horror in the way that there's an unnerving sense as one is watching (if you haven't seen the particular film before or many in the genre, like me!) that they're really going to push the envelope. Naw... make that TOTALLY cross the line with depicting extremely explicit violence and gore, breaking many American film taboos. I find many recent American horror films to have a tongue-and-cheek feel to them, making the blood and gore into an almost circus-like show. Villains are comical, shooting off these one-liners as they slay victims or vice versa. Plus, in Italian films, the action is usually accompanied by this bizarre dialogue and/or THAT CRAZY MUSIC. I gotta say, the two songs they use in this movie, especially the disco one, as cheesy-bad as they are, have been haunting me ever since. However, 'House on the Edge of the Park' didn't quite live up to my anxious expectation. I WAS very nervous and fearful throughout the first half of the film in not knowing what to expect after psycho Alex (David Hess) and his friend hit the party. But, surprisingly, it wasn't TOO horrible... not like I had expected anyway. First of all, there wasn't as much violent rape depiction as I thought there would be. I thought there would be women assaulted left and right. But I guess there's only so much harm two hoodlums can do. Aside from the rape at the beginning of the film, the two other sex scenes shown looked downright consensual(!)... even titillating. Lots of female nudity in this one, guys. Yet the scene with Alex and Cindy and his straight razor WAS pretty unsettling. The idea of being randomly sliced at with a razor definitely gives me the Hobie-jeebies. But most creepy to me was the was how the rest of the part guests just stood by and watched this happen to their friend for as long as they did. I thought the blond guy (Tom) was such a wimp! In fact, through most of the scenes at the house, the victimized guests all seem so passive, pretty much just allowing Alex and Ricky do what they wanted to do. To me, they just didn't seem scared or freaked out enough in the beginning when bad stuff started to happen. But I guess that is, again, all part of that unique ""tone"" with Italian horror that is so disarming.<br /><br />Perhaps the MOST interesting to me on the unrated DVD that I watched (the 'Shriek Show' edition) were the extras that include an interview with ""David Hess and Family."" First of all, the interview is filmed very informally at what looks like the Hess home. I have no idea who the interviewer is, but his questions are heard on camera, which is very unusual. Amusingly, some of the interviewer's questions are somewhat pointless and tactless, in my opinion. This is especially evident when the interviewer tries to touch on the subject of David Hess' wife, Karoline Mardeck, also being in the film. Mr. Hess quickly shuts him down and in a somewhat menacing tone tells him something to the effect of, ""I thought I told you we weren't going to talk about that..."" Weird! After the David Hess interview, when his wife Karoline is being interviewed by herself, the interviewer tries to again bring up the subject of her being in the film and she just looks away uncomfortably saying ""I don't want to talk about it."" Well, it's no wonder. Karoline Mardeck plays the girl that David Hess' character Alex rapes and kills in her car in the beginning of the film! Her name is Susan in the credits but I'm pretty sure I never heard her name uttered in the film. It's funny, because David Hess casually and openly discusses his relationship and interaction with the other actors in the film, but when it comes to talking about his wife's role in the film, he understandably becomes guarded. It's very awkward how they BOTH become so dismissive about it, like trying to deny it happened. But in a way, I have to say that I respect Mr. Hess for not wanting to talk about this degrading role his wife played in order to protect her/their privacy. I'm not sure if they were married at the time it was filmed, but in listening to Karoline recall during her interview how/when she and David met, it was on a plane to NYC in 1975 so it seems like they at least had been in some type of relationship for several years before this movie was filmed. In any case, I'm sure that's the LAST thing any married couple would want to talk about--how one sexually brutalized the other on film for all posterity. Amid all the sexploitation and violence surrounding this film, that was a humanizing aspect that comforted me in a strange way. What I also got from the interview is that David Hess, although strange, is a pretty deep and real guy with some interesting insights into the characters he's played and the movies he's made. Plus, the fact that he's had a fairly successful career as a musician (even composing songs for his other notorious horror flick, 'Last House on the Left') makes him even more intriguing as an actor and person.<br /><br />As for 'House on the Edge of the Park,' I only recommend if you are a fan of the Italian horror genre, sexploitation films, and of course, David A. Hess."
"49955_0.txt",334,"I've never seen a more obviously stupid TV show that insults the viewers intelligence more than this one. (But there are probably a lot of contenders out there.) The judges are hams, led by Mr. Cheese Fest himself David Hasselhoff, and rounded out by everyone's favorite biyach - Sharon Osborne. The British judge is another nobody, and the black stage hand gives out the oldest and worst reused one liners in comedic lore. ""This is crazytown and that guy's the mayor."" AAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Obviously the really bad contestants are placements or fillers. Nobody is that stupid to believe these lame acts are serious. (Or are there wrestling fans out there?) There is some talent in the mix of stupid acts and serious acts no doubt, but wading through the imbeciles is not my idea of entertainment. It's insulting to think that the producers actually believe that the audience falls for this.<br /><br />I saw all of this in the 70's with The Gong Show which was fresher and funnier.

Heche is ably supported by Diane Ladd, a religious woman who can quote the bible but could not control her rebellious daughter.<br /><br />The film deals with how a sharp 16 year old has to learn to play the system to keep her brothers together. Bright, perceptive and unfortunately victimized by a sick mother, Kristen Bell gives a splendid performance.<br /><br />I enjoyed the part where she meets a black young man who becomes her boyfriend.

"240_0.txt",337,"Released amid a horde of Korean romantic comedies following the success of ""My Sassy Girl"", Singles--I found--was not simply another manufactured commodity. It broke some major clichés that are risky for any studio film to deviate from. There was realistic acting of genuine human behaviors underneath the surface of light-hearted humor, which may I add, is very funny! I would even consider this film to be a great painting of the common people. A lot of films take the escapist approach to deviate its content from real life; in my opinion that is a perfectly legitimate way to make films, and while Singles certainly has its share of over-the-top moments (which are highly enjoyable), I found it to resemble life more than most genre films. And, if art is to imitate life, then I consider Singles to be a successful work of art. It's great to see films incorporating both wild entertainment AND something meaningful that we can take away from."
"2761_0.txt",338,"Before viewing this film, I watched the trailer to get a quick glimpse, and immediately I classified this film as a comedy, but after actually viewing the film I realized the seriousness of the piece. Denzel Washington startled me with his ""decent"" British accent and his ability to remain consistent throughout the film. I, in no way, can relate to the plight of the protagonist yet I understand the feeling of betrayal, therefore I was rooting for him all the way. The plot was definitely long-winded and I was lost a few times, but surprisingly it all came together at the end. Even though he met his demise at the end, I was happy to see one of the many antagonist (the crooked police officer) killed off (this is where the sheer delight comes in). Overall the movie was pretty good and kept my attention. However, I found certain segments of the film unnecessary. Will I view again? Probably not."

"22312_0.txt",340,"Red Dwarf is, without a doubt, my absolute, all-time, favourite TV program. I absolutely love everything about it. The performances are brilliant, and considering when Craig Charles joined the crew it was his first acting job, that's not to be underestimated. The story writing is superb. The jokes are sharp, witty and extremely hilarious. I wouldn't go as far as saying that it's the funniest thing I've EVER seen, but that isn't all that makes it my favourite program.<br /><br />I have every series on DVD and watching them repeatedly is somewhat a hobby of mine. The way the characters are developed is brilliant and every single story of every episode is genius, clever and brings you into the Dwarf world more and more. Other than making me break out in fits of laughter every other line, it also offers intense entertainment through its action and adventures. Despite the fact that Lister's a 25 year old Liverpudlian space bum, Kryten is a robot, Rimmer is a hologram and the Cat is, well, a Cat, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor wrote every episode and every series so beautifully that I can really relate to the characters and feel like I'm a part of their world when I watch it.<br /><br />This is no doubt one of a long line of classic British comedies that I would love to see brought back to life, the only difference is that this SHOULD be reborn. The eighth series ended with a terrible cliff hanger that was, sadly, not to be resolved, and I really think that the BBC should pull it's finger out of it's cavity and commission a ninth series to give the show the full, complete conclusion that it deserves. It was a waste to let the Red Dwarf era fizzle out all those years ago and I hope to god that something gets done about it."
"11056_0.txt",341,"I love all of Linda Howard's books, and was thrilled to accidentally run across this film on WE. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Not only was the plot completely different from Ms. Howard's storyline, the acting was mediocre at best. I was dismayed at the complete lack of chemistry between the two lead actors. I am a big fan of escapist romance, and I can forgive a lot of schmaltz and cheesiness in a low budget film if there is a credible connection between the characters and the plot is even halfway believable. But this movie embarrasses a genre that to begin with does not have much to recommend it in terms of higher artistic value. Don't waste your time watching this movie - especially if you are expecting it to resemble the book in any way whatsoever. But do check out some of Linda Howard's novels. She writes quality romantic escapism without forsaking skillful character development and interesting, suspenseful plots. She is a talented writer.

It sounded interesting enough - a group of people get trapped in a old house with something nasty, which is usually a sign that I might see some cool gore. However, when I read on the video box that this was a Troma movie, I almost passed on it. I was kinda burnt out on Troma's cheesy approach to horror. This movie has it's share of cheese too, but this film was acquired by Troma, not produced by Troma, so there's not as much of it. Actually, I was quite surprised by this film. It's very low-budget, but like most horror films, the low-budget adds to the creepiness of the film. Good gore effects, some decent acting, a cool location (kinda reminded me of Night of the Demons) and a warped sense of humor adds up to one bizarre little film. It's got some boring parts, but for a Troma movie, it was very enjoyable!<br /><br />"
"30560_0.txt",343,"I remember seing this movie as a teenager when it was new. I still remember how the touching story burned inside of me, and the soft music that soothened the flames, created a epic memory. Since that first time, I have watched this movie at least ten times and it is STILL as great as the fist time. I really feels lika a ""true story"". Not like the rough (and often stupid) picture of vikings that Hollywood creates. I highly recommend anyone (above 11) to see this movie!"
"31446_0.txt",344,"While the original EVIL DEAD was genuinely a horror film, this one went completely the opposite direction and decided to amp up the gore factor to make it basically a demented cartoon show. EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is really a re-telling of the same events from the first story, but in this case, only Ash and Linda (Bruce Campbell and Denise Bexler) come to the cabin and less than 10 minutes into the movie he has played a recording from a professor who mouths the infamous lines from the Necronomicon and unwittingly brought his girlfriend to an untimely death, though she herself becomes re-animated and returns to torment him as a severed head and a body with a chainsaw in its hands who unwittingly slices itself in two.<br /><br />And this is only the beginning of a movie that will not let down the zaniness, as the professor's daughter makes an appearance with her partner and two locals and get sucked into the madness that ensues. Raimi uses a hyper-kinetic editing to make the essentially silly story even sillier -- the POV of an eyeball flying into the screaming mouth of a woman is a (pun intended) scream -- and distorting the dead into stop-motion figurines only adds to the lunacy. Looney Tunes gone berserk (even the furniture becomes possessed), not precisely frightening, but swiftly paced and with great use of Bruce Campbell's over-the-top acting and slapstick humor. Hilarious, entertaining stuff."
"13010_0.txt",345,"Look into a mirror, preferably alone at night, and say ""candy-man"" 5 times and...uh...see what happens. Little known Bernard Rose directed this terrifying horror/suspense/thriller set and filmed in Chicago. The story is adapted from a novel by horror master Clive Barker. Two attractive female graduate students research an urban ""myth"" only to discover it may not be a myth, or is it? That's the premise of this tightly written and directed film, which does for looking into mirrors what Psycho did for taking showers. This is a thinking man's horror film that scares the daylights out of you at times while still leading you to think beyond what's on the screen.<br /><br />It's much more than just a horror film with a creepy man goring people to death. It exploits many of our deepest fears about society and in ourselves, such as: what can happen in a run down public housing complex (Chicago's notorious Cabrini-Green projects), and can our fears remove the certainty of what we know to be untrue? Rose expertly weaves in Hitchcockian themes of being wrongly accused, emotional vulnerability, and psychological exploitation, while maintaining interest and building a high level of tension throughout the film. Philip Glass' quasi-religious score consistently provides an eerie companion when the camera takes us into seemingly normal locations, like a public restroom for instance. Truly one of the very best horror films of the 90's that can disturb your thoughts, penetrate your sense of security, and still provide disturbing gore and violence. This film is not for the faint of heart. Virginia Madsen stars as the main character and doesn't strike a false note. Tony Todd is the candy-man, and he doesn't appear to deliver gumdrops. Don't look behind you! *** of 4 stars."

Within weeks of the initial outbreak, the virus had engulfed the entire planet: from the smallest rural communities to the greatest cities. Soon the earth was infested with a new threat - the undead. Three video diaries explore the dystopian world that was left behind - charting the early days of the plague, through to the last days of the apocalypse.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Don't let the name fool you. ""The Zombie Diaries"" is not really a zombie movie. Basically, the zombies are kept in the background and don't really pose a threat throughout the whole movie. They show up every so (not) often and stumble around. That's about it. The rest of the film is full of pointless dialogue and a terrible ""Hostel"" like subplot that doesn't really make any sense, is totally unnecessary and has absolutely nothing to do with zombies.<br /><br />I liked the hand-held camera idea but it's not as well done as in ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""REC"". I also liked how all three video diaries are connected with each other...but that's all I liked about the movie.<br /><br />The acting is awful...really, really bad. The writers make it impossible to care about any of the characters because there is zero character development - the characters themselves could have been zombies and it wouldn't have made any difference.

"26763_0.txt",353,"""Big Night"" came off to me exactly like a movie that a bunch of actors who were friends decided to make together and of course each one wanted at least one big dramatic scene for themselves, so those of their friends that were writing the script and the friend directing gave them each one. And that was pretty much the entire story. They forgot that acting is not about ""playing a character,"" it is about giving the audience an experience. My experience was that they were not in the least concerned with me, the watcher. It was all ego on the screen.

"23370_0.txt",356,"I found the movie simply brilliant, and i must say i find weird that many people focus their attention on the war, which is not the key of the movie itself. In my opinion the war is roughly depicted because it is just a ""place"" within which the main story unfolds. The emphasis is on the characters, their unpredictable encounter and the situations that make possible for them to become friends and maybe even companions. There is a phrase said Smith taking back the grandma while the village keeps up with the party that somehow sums up the movie: ""Such a good time. That's life."".<br /><br />Besides, i particularly appreciated the acting of the crazy girl, Hye-jeong Kang (which i already saw in Old Boy) which is also probably the best character. Watching the movie i found more than a similitude with two movies from Hayao Miyazaki: Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (for the hidden village idea and the lantern-statues as well) and Mononoke Hime (for the wild boar scene, which by the way is one of the best of Dongmakgol, original and simply brilliant). Only later i realized it was mostly due to the music, which is in fact composed by Joe Hisaishi, who made the music for these Miyazaki movies too; once again, his work is superb.<br /><br />One thing i always wait for is a movie's ending scene (mostly cause i've seen too many movies ruined in the last part... A.I. for example), and i must say i loved this one, when we see why the young communist soldier had a flower too, and who gave him it. No special happy ending for the village or whatever, just a moment when all of them where together, 6 as the 6 butterflies that we saw flying away from the snow a few moments before. ;)"
"12835_0.txt",357,"I watched the entire series 1 and 2 whilst I was supposed to finish my thesis - nagging deadlines, raging teachers and what not could not dissuade me from watching this first, then finish my Master's degree - one has to set priorities! The series is brilliant for a number of reasons: 1. The animation. Admittedly not as brilliant as the movies, but I didn't expect that either: series work on a lower budget per minute of animation produced. Considering that, what they've achieved is just so magnificently well executed, it just took my breath away.<br /><br />2. The soundtrack. Both title tracks are sung by Origa, and by Jove, are those song 'hooks': even if you donlt care for anime or watching TV anyhow, these tracks glue you to the screen form the first second you hear them. Good job.<br /><br />3. The Plot & Philosophy. Even though I've seen series with a bit more 'driving' plots (these series being certain seasons of X-files, Millennium and Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the overarching polt is just amazing. I spent half my days googling all the hints, reading 'Catcher in the Rhye' and Baudrillard and more, just to make sure I wouldn't miss any possible hint or twist.<br /><br />4. Philosophy & the Future. Next to the philosophical underpinnings of the plot, there's also the technicological future the makers foresee. Whereas in the movies we got to see more of the development of 'individuality' under the advancements of technology, we get to see more of the development of 'society', harking back to the original manga-series a bit more. Here also the production team show their intellectual savvy. Although they saved the guest appearance for Donna Haraway for the movie 'Innocence', this series has 'Cyborg Manifesto' written all over it. But their vision goes even beyond these more airy abstract questions: the picture they paint of what the everyday details of future life would be like, are just so incredibly real and on target, it just blows your mind away.<br /><br />I truly believe that this series accurately describes what our future looks like - and every time I hear a news item stating that 'scientists have succeeded in linking this and this computer programme directly to the human brain' or 'more and more shops are opening up in Second Life' or whatever, I now constantly think: we're one step closer to Ghost in the Shell. So, even if you don't like anime, go see this. You'll see your own future."

"9283_0.txt",359,"I only just watched 'Son of the Sheik' on dvd last night and was amazed at the textures of cinematography and the natural un-histrionic flow of the performances. While it may not be very profound or innovative, it never set out to be, and it is a far better flick than I expected, very rounded and organic and effortless. Vilma Banky is lovely and appropriately lowkey, and Valentino is every bit as exciting to watch as his celebrity maintained. Ahmed is NOT a character performance, Oscar material or anything, but Valentino instills this cardboard figure with the warmth of life, a quickening of the pulse, all very controlled and tasteful and humanly affecting rather than superhumanly virile. Of course he looks gorgeous, but so does the film itself. Some of the slapstick may seem dated by now, but then what about 'American Pie'."
"1691_0.txt",360,"""The Wizard Of Speed And Time"" is a low-budget movie loosely based on the trivial adventures of a special effects person (Jitlov) who is making a short movie. I sought out this movie after reading many glowing reviews on IMDb. Despite wanting to like it, I found the hype to be unfounded.<br /><br />Dated music and visuals along with cheesy humor screams out ""80's movie"". Inexpensive early synthesizers in simplistic arrangements were used for a large part of the music. For visuals, somewhat crude stop-motion photography is the order of the day. Never do you finish a scene without having to digest the awkward and unnatural effects. Even keeping in mind that this is a low budget movie, we never cross over into cherishing the effects for what they are, and instead lose whatever redeeming value they could have otherwise had. <br /><br />As a fan of Airplane!, I enjoy 'low-brow' humor. Unfortunately, ""Wizard"" is not nearly in the same league. Puns sometimes replaced any real attempt at adding any substantial humor. Scenes showing Jitlov's dealings with various unions (complete with double-talk representatives) left me cold, despite their humorous target. The various flat-lined police scenes (often involving mock-chase scenes) produced groans instead of laughs. In other parts, clever visuals took the place of real humor. Often, a small effect (for instance, glasses that glowed at the right moment) inspired a smile. Unfortunately, cute effects can't bridge over the large gaps in humor this movie has, and ""Wizard"" never goes beyond a level that only pre-teen audiences can enjoy. <br /><br />""Wizard"" contains Jitlov's running commentary on Hollywood unions. Jitlov reduces the movie industry to a two-dimensional caricature of evil and incompetence. In one case, a movie producer ambushes Jitlov's efforts at every turn in order to win a bet. ""Wizard"" is also laced with running themes about Hollywood union lock-down. For example, studio executives use creative accounting to allow the non-union Jitlov to make his short while remaining out of union sight. ""This potentially political statement lacks the bite it needed to come across as anything but fluff. Instead, it becomes lost 'in the mix'.<br /><br />Script limitations left the actors out in the cold. Philip Michael Thomas (""Miami Vice"") played a bit-part policeman that had no significant role in the plot other than to chase some conveniently placed bad guys. His character ends up slapped on top of a script held together by loosely-based vignettes. Stephen Stucker (who nearly stole the show in ""Airplane!"") had even less screen time. His last screen appearance, Stucker's comic talents unfortunately are never allowed to surface. In the end, Jitlov spends too much time in front of the screen with his only 'adequit' acting skills.<br /><br />Some have made much of the movie showing behind-the-scenes glimpses of how special effects are done. Nobody is going to walk away from ""Wizard"" a special effects expert. While ""Wizard"" held a few moments of interest (notably, the 'running on the wall' effect), most everything fell into simple 'common sense'. <br /><br />In conclusion, this isn't the 'diamond in the rough' that some have suggested. I wanted to like ""Wizard"", but the many flaws quickly grew tedious. If you do come across it, take a look. Just don't get your hopes too high."

Neither dramatic enough to constitute a drama nor thrilling enough to be considered a thriller, the pacing is lethargic and there's barely a soupçon of suspense throughout. Character development is limited, and, even where attempted, ultimately uninvolving. This is not helped by the director's tiresome insistence on casting Stathis Papadopoulos purely on the basis (it seems) that the actor is extremely buff. I don't know about you, but I often find it quite helpful if an actor can act.<br /><br />The depiction of the racism and xenophobia that lurks beneath the surface of contemporary Greece is perhaps the most interesting aspect of a film that offers no other message and little by way of entertainment."

"36355_0.txt",364,"Got to see FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO recently; saw it last about 20 years ago. The same thing that I'd forgotten bothered me then came back to bother me once more: I simply could not get past the fact that Franchot Tone's accent was never taken into account by the German characters in the story. Of a sudden, Tone, a British Armoured sergeant (with a ""suspect"" British accent), adopts the identity of the spy Davos, with no noticeable change of accent. Nor does Wilder, the film's director, account for the nationality of Davos. Is Davos multilingual? Are we to assume he's addressing Rommel in German? English? French? This inexplicable glitch compromises the verisimilitude of the entire film and strains the viewer's credulity. As a result, I could not enjoy other elements of the film to the fullest, despite a charming performance by Akim Tamiroff. Furthermore, Von Stroheim is totally miscast as Rommel who, by all accounts, was a svelte, elegant, and heroic figure, not a vainglorious, pompous, and porcine caricature."

The film is everything that you'll never want to watch. The scenes are disturbing, gut wrenching, mind twisting, and way over the top. In result, ""A Clockwork Orange"" has the most powerful and overwhelming dramatic impact that I have ever experienced in a mainstream film. <br /><br />	""A Clockwork Orange"" is the story of a young man named Alex DeLarge, who is, by day, a regular student who lives with his parents at home, but, by night, a homicidal rapist/killer with his accomplices who dress up like demented clowns at a bleak freak show. He and his buddies weasel their way into the happy homes housing innocent people by chanting the same deceiving phrase every night: they scream that their friend has been critically wounded in an accident near by--and plead to use their telephone to call for help.<br /><br />For a few unfortunate souls, this devious trick proves to be successful in nature. One night, however, a woman known as ""The Cat Lady,"" refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion. Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside. Once indoors, a fight begins. A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by ""Cat Lady,"" one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder. Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise.<br /><br />After the process of being sent to prison, Alex grows to learn to tell offices and guards what they like to hear. He reads the bible, is never involved with any major fights or complications, and almost volunteers for a new kind of experiment. An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps. What it does, though a series of ""sessions,"" is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.<br /><br />The scenes involving the ""cure"" of Alex's disturbances are truly emotionally troublesome. They are so explicit and detailed that I myself felt tempted to look away from the screen at points. This is not a film for those who are prone to walk out of movies, those who are easily offended, or especially for those with week stomachs. This is the most grizzly enumerated film I have even screened, but it happens to be one of the most perfect and precise in message. I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though. <br /><br />The soundtrack to ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most inspirational and spirited ones I have ever heard; right up there with the turns to ""The Graduate"" (1967). Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.<br /><br />Here, a young Malcolm McDowell explores the character of a lifetime with vivid imagination and tremendous description. His character fits him very well as an actor. Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind. Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement. It investigates the mind of a killer, rapist, and a confused, somewhat harmless, adolescent--all existing in the same character. This is no doubt the character, and the performance, that inspired a generation.<br /><br />As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to ""A Clockwork Orange"" also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes. There is a scene in this movie that forces two parents to make a decision of a lifetime. After receiving the treatments he volunteered for, Alex returns to his household only to discover that the only mom and dad he's even known have rented his old room out to some strange college kid, who is said to have been there for them during many hard times--like a real son. His parents must make a choice: to throw their only son, who has suffered for years in turn for making others suffer, out of the house for good, or allow him to return with open arms trusting that he is ""cured.""

"12724_0.txt",371,"For ninety minutes this film has two characters talk and argue about the troubles that they are having in their relationship and I thought of one thing, if a friend of yours started to complain about their relationship could you listen to them for ninety minutes? Me either, but this film expects you to. Story is about a couple that have been dating for a few years but decide that they should break up and after spending some time apart it doesn't take long before they start calling each other and getting together for great sex. Steve (Russell Crowe) and Monica (Salma Hayek) talk about that they are not together anymore but still hop into bed with one another and then talk and argue until one of them leaves. Later one of them will phone the other up and the whole process starts again with sex, talk, and more arguing.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />One day Steve shows up at Monica's work and tells her that they should get married and after mulling about it for a short time she accepts. Steve starts dreaming and when he finally wakes up he is at the altar but he is unable to utter the words ""I do"" and passes out. Monica has had it with him and leaves him for good and even though he doesn't want her to leave there isn't anything he can say to change her mind.<br /><br />This film is directed by Robert Greenwald who was either handicapped by an extremely thin budget or has no clue how to construct a real film. This was shot in New York City but aside from a taxi with New York printed on the doors you would have been hard pressed to figure out where it's suppose to take place. There isn't one good shot of that beautiful city and instead the films focus remains on the two lead actors and even with their immense talent they just cannot keep the audiences attention on something so trivial and mundane. Glenda Jackson starred in a film called ""Stevie"" in the 1970's and she had to carry that film herself also and even though I thought she succeeded this is a task that's practically impossible even for the best actors. It all boils down to the material that they are handed and this script is just to dull. Some have said that Crowe and Hayek have no chemistry on screen but I'm not so quick to agree with that because the lines that they are forced to utter is so banal. Greenwald directed this film from the play by Michael Cristofer and I'm not sure what drew his attention to this but the end result is a dull film that is both poorly constructed and repetitious."
"27116_0.txt",372,"I first watched this film in an Early Modern European history course and it blew me away. As a film buff it's interesting. It's a lot like a silent film (i.e. Griffith) with all the narrative frames in between each scene. As a socialist I find this film invaluable as a gateway to Winstanley's writings. He was truly a man ahead of his time."
"26382_0.txt",373,"Despite the fact that Mel Gibson is a not-so-great guy as a person, there's no denying that he's a master when it comes to film-making. This movie was not just fast paced and intense, it was visually stunning. The characters are all well developed so we actually care about them (and hate the bad guys). The acting was well done; there weren't any moments that had me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />The only turn-off would be the large amount of bloodshed throughout the movie. Although this doesn't bother me at all, there are a lot of people who will be nauseated by the violence. Among these scenes include people being sacrificed by having their hearts torn out, then being be-headed, and a person being completely torn apart by a Jaguar.<br /><br />The music fits the film extremely well. There's not much of a running theme. It's mostly underscoring; the type of music that keeps the film moving but doesn't completely stand out.<br /><br />There are many cool camera effects, especially the use of slow motion throughout the film. There are also many aerial camera angles, allowing us to see characters in pursuit of each other from the tree-tops.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this film is extremely intense, fast paced, and original. If you are looking for a film experience that you wont soon forget, I completely recommend it. If you have a weak stomach and don't enjoy being on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes, don't see this movie."
"6348_0.txt",374,"It has been years since I have seen this movie and I have been looking for it for a long time. I still remember moments in the movie as if I just saw it yesterday because of its gripping mature story line and deep rich character portrayals. I still get goosebumps when I think about it. The plot development was powerful with what I found to be a shocking conclusion. I find classic story telling with intense character portrayals to be much more interesting than some of the movie gimmicks used by most of the industry today. This movie is not shy on realism or story. I guess that some of that which makes up the high quality depth of this motion picture story simply goes over the head of some people, (based on some of the other reviews I have read about this film). I believe this is an absolute must see for McCrea or Russell fans."

"11122_0.txt",376,"After a contentious decade for Robert Altman, during which he was pretty much shunned by the Hollywood system and made some of his worst films, it's only fitting that he should cap the decade off with an absolute triumph, this absorbing mini-series made for HBO.<br /><br />I don't know why it took so long for someone to pair ""Doonesbury"" writer Garry Trudeau with Altman, because in retrospect, it seems like a match made in heaven. Both have the exact same sarcastic sense of humor and the talent for seeing the absurd in the mundane. They crafted a fascinating look into the world of political machinations, following the story of fictitious 1988 presidential candidate Jack Tanner but setting it against the real world of the democratic primaries. Therefore, actual members of the political scene at the time interact with star Michael Murphy as if he's a real presidential nominee, and the viewer is never sure what action is authentic and what is staged.<br /><br />Murphy is superb as Tanner, and he's perfectly cast. Tanner is handsome and charismatic enough to make a fairly successful run for the nomination, but he's too bland and too nice to make it all the way. The series examines one of the major conundrums about American politics: to have a candidate with conviction and good ideas isn't enough. He must also be a personality and be able to navigate the tricky terrain of the American media, with the result that those who go farthest are those who know how to work the system, not those who are most honest. ""Tanner '88"" captured perfectly my own feelings about presidential elections. On the one hand, they're of supreme importance, because they determine who will be the leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world. But on the other hand, they seem like such pointless exercises, and it's hard to muster up the energy to care time after time.<br /><br />But one of the strongest and most serious points made by this series comes in an episode in which Tanner visits the slums of Detroit in his home state of Michigan. He realizes that he is completely out of touch with the very people he promises to help, and has no clue about what their lives are really like. That's painfully true about our own leadership -- it was in 1988 and still is today. There's a vast and probably insurmountable gap between the privileged few who ever have the remotest hope of being president and the millions of average Americans over whom they govern.<br /><br />All of the acting in ""Tanner '88"" is sensational, to the point where I forgot I wasn't just watching real people being filmed by a documentary filmmaker. Most notable are Pamela Reed, as Tanner's campaign manager, Cynthia Nixon, as his overbearing and very young daughter, and E.G. Marshall, who makes a few memorable appearances as Tanner's awful father.<br /><br />This is a must see for Altman fans, or really anyone with an interest in American politics.<br /><br />Grade: A+"
"537_0.txt",377,"One big damn mess... I was duped into believing this to be a horror film but it is just a dumb mystery psycho-drama with plenty of bad acting, predictable plot development, and an absolutely absurd premise that hasn't got an iota of credibility or realism to it.

What's worse, the entire British police force and its detectives and psychologists can't figure the mystery out, and are deceived by a half-crazed teen who hasn't eaten or drank much for a fortnight!

"30148_0.txt",381,"Note: This is probably the longest review I have ever written and it mostly deals with the source of controversy surrounding Natural Born Killers, so if you just want a brief summary of why this film is worth watching, skip to the end!<br /><br />I remember when Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was released in 1994 and delivered a well-deserved kick up the arse to American audiences. Stone set out to criticize media for its mindless glorification of violence and criminals in the media and did so through a sharp satirical spectacle about two infamous killers-turned-idols, starring the ""it"" actors of the early 90s. <br /><br />Unsurprisingly, conservative American families were outrageddisgusted at what was presented to them and saw the film itself as a mindless glorification of violence and criminals as opposed to criticism. Indeed, they were so outraged that, when teen-fans left their Oklahoma home to go out east and shoot fellow Americans, parents blamed Natural Born Killers for having inspired the shootings. Oliver Stone was left with blood on his hands, while more murders were being linked to his masterpiece. Lawsuits were filed; cases were tried and reinstalled, until finally they were dismissed in Louisiana in 1998. <br /><br />The reason I bring this up again, after so many years, and so many more violent films later, is because Entertainment Weekly has published a list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies of All Time and Natural Born Killers is ranked as #8. Now, I don't want to knock Entertainment Weekly as they report on reality, but when a film like NBK gets a high ranking as 8, they should be called Entertainment, Weakly. My point is, rather, that this is a film that dealt with such an important, realistic issue that it should never have been controversial in the first place. So why was it?<br /><br />The reason for this high ranking, I assume, is the ending of the film. Instead of opting for your typical, clichéd cop-out in which the ""good guys"" win and the ""bad guys"" are punished, Stone lets Mickey and Mallory Knoxthe glorified killersget away with precisely everything and ride off in their car on the highway. This was what lead to a public outcry and what caused an anti-violence film like Natural Born Killers to be mistaken for a pro-violence advertisement. <br /><br />Firstly, it is my opinion that audiences who need everything to be carefully spelled out for them in a film in order to get the message and morals right are probably devoid of morals in the first place (no offense, Crash (2004)). So because Natural Born Killers did not have a perfect righteous ending with a ""good guy"" shaking his finger and telling you that this was unacceptable and having the bad guy repent their crime, some people took this as homage to serial killers. This fills me with concern for your average movie-goer. <br /><br />Secondly, Natural Born Killers shouldn't have inspired this much controversy because, while it often exaggerates to get its message across, it is realistic to the coreand why should realism be labeled controversial? Isn't it just the opposite? Having violence in a film is a realistic portrayal of the world today. Having media glorify violence is even more so, because that is what is happening. By making Mickey and Mallory Knox into infamous symbols (""If I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory!"" one worshipping teen tells the TV camera team), Stone is parodying reality. He is parodying the idea of media turning serial killers, like Jeffrey Dahmer, into celebrities. Dahmer was on the cover of new magazines more than once, for example. The prison interview with Mickey is based upon the Charles Manson interview with reporter Geraldo Rivera. The story told on ""American Maniacs"" about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in an attempt to try to silence the couple's growing fan base. In other words, no one can argue that Natural Born Killers is not a realistic portrayal of the media's response to criminals.<br /><br />Now thirdly, it is my guess that the film struck a little too close to home when it opened and therefore attracted unfair criticism. It pointed to things that were too familiar with audiences. Take the famous sitcom scenes of Mallory's family, featuring hammy acting, clown-like sound effects and canned laughter. All the stylistic elements were present it was just the content that was overblown; Mallory's father made lewd suggestions and it all culminated in a ruthless killing spree. Yet, somehow, it was still funny because it was so close to the average sitcom. This was Stone's intention. In prison, when Mickey is being interviewed on national TV, the film cuts to a simple black and white image of a typical American home. The family is sitting around watching the interview, glued to the television like mindless zombiesthe very same people who hated this film. That's biting irony.<br /><br />So, controversial? I have watched Natural Born Killers many times and cannot see anything else than a satirical masterpiece. I also do not think that exaggerating images or scenarios is overkill  I think exaggerating morals and 'happy endings' to get a point across is overkill. Natural Born Killers had the perfect balance and was meant to be taken tongue-in-cheek. It doesn't glorify violence; it shows how desensitized the media and the public have become to it. And it does so with flair and fury. <br /><br />9 out of 10"

"46653_0.txt",389,"This film is just so... weird. Ever since accidentally buying ""Ninja Terminator"", I've become somewhat of a fan of Godfrey Ho, because his movies are just so mind blowingly terrible and disjointed they cause hilarity, albeit unintentionally.<br /><br />According to a short little recap at the start of this film, Gold Ninja Warrior is either the sequel or prequel to ""Ninja Terminator"" (or maybe a retelling of the same story or anything, it's kinda hard to tell). However, the tale of the titular statue is completely lost in the tale of a sex slave, drug dealing, gun trading ring of gangsters being taken down by a ninja.<br /><br />Unfortunately, unlike Ninja Terminator, the fight scenes in this film are just terrible. Not only that, but I'm fairly sure that there is actually more time dedicated on screen to watching helpless women being beaten up and raped than there is ninjas fighting. I might be wrong on that, but this film has the only graphic sex scene which I actually felt *wrong* after seeing.<br /><br />Speaking of the rape scene (and you'll know it immediately), it doesn't even make sense. So a fat business man can rape a ninja? The woman had previously killed about 50 bajillion armed gangsters single handedly, and now she has a small length of rope around her wrists (her legs are fine), she can't fight off an overweight, middle aged, unarmed business man? No. Doesn't make sense.<br /><br />As the one line summary above suggests, I believe that this film is actually a look into the minds of the creators of this film more than anything else. There is an unnecessarily large amount of time dedicated to seeing nude women being hit, which considering the summary on the back of my DVD box says ""...the Red Ninjas intend to steal the statue and send their best Ninja heroine to draw out the Golden Ninjas leader, Max."" seems just wrong. Also, none of that blurb actually happens. The only time the statue appears is in the recap of events in ""Ninja Terminator"" right at the start.<br /><br />This film just plain sucks, even for a Godfrey Ho film (and he is involved, albeit uncredited, and I'm not 100% convinced that Joseph Lai isn't another pseudonym of him anyway). The fight scenes are just plain boring. The only guy in the film who looks like he has any training only appears for about 2 minutes and then gets lamely knocked over by the lead character. The plot makes no sense and randomly jumps about. The editing is terrible (people will jump off a wall dressed as a ninja and land dressed regularly, then 4 seconds later be a ninja again, and so on).<br /><br />Go buy Ninja Terminator instead. That is an amusingly bad film with surprisingly good fight scenes (even if Jaguar One is a complete and utter dick for no reason), and doesn't feel you leaving dirty like this film does."
"28976_0.txt",390,"First of all I'd like to explain why I gave this film a 10. I don't rate in comparison to other films because I take each film on its own, and I couldn't fault this film one bit. I was thinking of rating it a 9 just because it was a bit short in length but then again I thought that it was that good that I wanted more. The animation is amazing. You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime. To be honest I was expecting nothing less from studio Ghibli. The story is haunting in its simplicity. They are right to say its one of the best anti-war movies of all time. The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary. They give us the raw nature of the human kind and most of all the unspoilt love that can only be found between siblings. I watched the subtitled version of the film. It's truly worth it.

Eric Cartman obviously remains a focus, and in this one he's getting it, but somehow out of his own fault.<br /><br />Taking a picture of him having his penis stuck in Butter's mouth while holding his thumbs up may appear perverted in THIS context... But if you try to get into the minds of children, it may sounds reasonable. It works, as politically correct I'm trying to be in my awareness, this episode is not immoral or sick, no, it just shows a classical situation of misunderstanding that most of us have probably already been into. Definitely in a similar context but maybe in a similar feeling.<br /><br />I liked it... All the time while I was confronted with these scenes I thought ""Why not?""... He's just a boy (at least that's what we're supposed to know)!!!!"
"8392_0.txt",394,"Streets of Laredo is just as compelling as the original the only difference is that James Garner now holds the reins as Captain Woodrow Call,One of the most legendary Texas Rangers ever. Times have changed and so has Call's West. Things are changing as the 20 century looms closer and the wild west becomes Civilied. Woodrow Call is now a feared Bounty hunter and one of the greatest bounty hunters of his age. Call is now older but no wiser in the ways of the world and when he's hired to track down a Mexican Bandit named Joey Garza. Call Drags his ever loyal Corperal Pea-Eye Parker to help him track down the killer despite Pea-Eye now being married and having a family of his own. Streets of Laredo is a study of loyalties and betrayals to old ideas. Garner is simpling outstanding as Call. he is rivaled by George Carlin in a dramatic role a first for Carlin This movie shows us how the tale Ends but to me it still leaves a lot out maybe to lead to another story in the Lonesome Dove universe about the Final Years of Woodrow Call. Superb acting and a strong script make this a highly recommended movie which is official Canon unlike the sequel Return to Lonesome Dove which wasn't. Streets of Laredo can stand along side Lonesome Dove as one of the very best wild west stories ever told."
"48766_0.txt",395,"Many fans want different things from this film. Many fans, including myself, were hoping to see lots and lots of action. One Alien & Predator battle after another. Some fans were hoping for a edge of your seat, truly terrifying horror movie much like the original Alien. No matter what you want, hope, or expect from this film you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The direction this film takes is a horror route. It tries to be like the original Alien movie in the sense that the horror has to come more from the characters and their fear than from the monsters themselves. Paul Anderson tries to show as little Alien & Predator as possible without being ridiculous and let the actors & characters sell us the fear. Now this sounds like a good approach to a film and normally it would be. Here however it is the reason the films fall flat on its face. The problem being is that the characters aren't interesting and their actually paper thin cut outs. And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.<br /><br />But as I said, Paul Anderson tries to hide the monsters and show as little as possible much like the formula Ridley Scott & James Cameron used for their films. And thats where the film fails. Fans come to see this movie to see Aliens & Predators fighting. They don't come to see Sanna Lathan and the other people run around a dark pyramid. Fans didn't wait 14 years to see paper thin characters run around all over the place. They go to see Aliens & Predators.<br /><br />The film should have taken the action route and gives us large amounts of AVP battles. However Paul Anderson only gives us ONE, count them One, true fight scene between an ALien & predator. And that fight scene doesn't occur until half-way through the film and it only lasts 2 minutes. 2 minutes. As a fan I did not wait this long to see a AVP movie only to have one battle that lasts 2 minutes.<br /><br />Above I said ""true battle"" because there is technically another battle. It is between a Predator, Lex, and an Alien Queen. Much like the first AVP battle it is disappointingly short and 90% of the battle focuses on lex fighting the queen than it does focus on the Predator. After a while you begin to think the title ""Alien vs. Predator"" is inappropriate and instead should be called ""The Adventures of Lex"". Paul Andersons direction leaves out the two title characters.<br /><br />The idea of hiding your monsters appearance till half way through the film and rely more on your characters is a formula that has worked in the past. It even potentially could have worked here but in order for that to happen you need to do one thing. Make the characters more interesting. If your characters are paper thin then the audience aren't going to care about them and then they quickly become bored. The film should have done is focus less on characters and more on the monsters. It amazes me so much on how the film lacks on what the title promises."
"39897_0.txt",396,"It is embarrassing to watch a former master of the medium (Billy Wilder) create a shallow, bitter little piece like this. His lead character, a filmmaker desperate to work again, chases an aging movie star for his movie. He rails against the new kids taking over the movie industry with their hand-held cameras, dismissing in a stroke a whole new generation of filmmakers. The story is based on the thinnest of ideas, Holden looks like he has a hangover in every scene, and there is the stench of desperation hanging over the whole enterprise. We have all seen played out far too many times the sad tale of the former great this- or-that attempting a comeback and flopping because the juice is gone. That sums this movie up in spades. All in all it's a sad piece of work, and a reminder to bow out gracefully."
"23262_0.txt",397,"The first thing you'll notice when you first see the Episode is the Animation I mean the Animation isn't what you call Bad but it wasn't the best.

Also Isaac Hayes who was the first African American composer to win an Oscar for Best Original Song for the song Shaft appears in the Episode as the Voice of their singing School Chef, named Chef!"
"29306_0.txt",398,"If you watch this movie expecting a gore fest in the likes of Gozu and Ichi, you will be very surprised. Compared to Miike's others, Sukiyaki Western is like Bambi when it comes to gore and dementia. While I expected something else, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. When it comes to blood, Miike followed the old saying of ""quality, not quantity"". It is very tastefully done and certainly is one of the more original movies of our time. Miike really went the artistic route with this one. The entire movie utilizes a unique style of cinematography and uses colors that are symbolic to the plot.<br /><br />My copy of the movie was imported from Singapore. I haven't seen anyone mention the obvious flaw with the subtitles, so I'll assume it is unique to my copy. Like the other reviews said, the spoken word of the movie can be very hard to understand since the actors are speaking a language other than their native tongue, but when I turned on the subtitles, they turned out to be almost completely nonsensical! They read like a computer's bad translation mixed with Yoda-speak. The words related to what was being said, but they did not make sentences. It was very strange, and added a whole other atmosphere to the movie, probably unintentionally. Hopefully I stumbled on some sort of rare edition of the movie."
"48974_0.txt",399,"In a moment of self-vindication, Jamie Kennedy's love interest tells him that the most beautiful part about him is that he doesn't try to act like an adult. Therein lies the fault of Kickin' It Old School, its assumption that there is something virtuous in acting like a 13 year old, and an immature one at that, especially when it's writers are thirty something, and throwing their best material into the mix. To that end, Jamie Kennedy pulls out every trick in the book including fat jokes, gay jokes, racial slurs, bathroom humor, sex jokes, violence, Jewish jokes, retard jokes, a barrage of un-funny parodies of 80's wardrobe, dated colloquialisms, and over-played and un-original jokes resulting from a 20 year coma in a tragic attempt to mix back to the future, you got served, and some Adam Sandler movie. The abundant product placements and celebrity cameos makes it clear that Kennedy tried as hard to fund this film as he did to make it funny, calling in every favor and taking every opportunity to give a product unnecessary and often distracting camera time. For a film with so much corporate backing, one might expect camera and lighting work that was at least decent enough not to detract from an already lacking project. Luckily, the guest stars in the film didn't have much reputation to loose, since the product of their efforts is nothing short of a cataclysmic failure. Somewhere between a fat joke and a TiVo plug, there's an uninteresting and hackneyed plot about a desperate loser who has to do something big to win something back, imagine Happy Gilmore but with humor replaced with break dancing. This is what you'll get from Kennedy's Kickin' it Old School which features Kennedy as an adolescent boy in a 30-year-olds body who has just woken up from a 20 year coma to find out that the world has changed and has wholly passed him by. He must reunite his dance team and win a break dancing competition to pay off expensive medical bills and save his house, win the girl back from his evil nemesis, etc. etc. Perhaps Kennedy lost me when he started rubbing his fat best friends breasts, thankfully covered in a bra, but it seems that he often forgets which subplot he's working with, or rather what the main plot is altogether. If Kennedy seems convincing as a man with a 13-year-old mind, which he does not, it may be due to the fact that his humor never quite developed past a pubescent mentality. Maria Menunos seems oddly overwhelmed by a role that really should have been easy to pass off just on good looks. Kennedy himself is erratic, immature, and awkward with unkempt hair that parallels the movies and Kennedys lost sense of direction. Miguel Nunez Jr. revives the awkwardness that defeated Juana Man some years ago, a film with a plot and a performance about as disappointing as this one. Bobby Lee slips in and out of a stereotypical Asian parody that becomes MIT alum when he whips out his big vocabulary words, he is much more effective and funny in sketch comedy when he is no forced to extend his performance for more than five minutes. Michael Rosenbaum is refreshingly comedic in the light of his feeble co-stars. At one point in the film, Kennedy's character comments that his dancing crew is just a bunch of 30 year old guys acting like losers since they are stuck in a 13 year old mentality, This proves to be the most interesting moment in the film since the viewer is left to wonder whether the dialogue pertains to the plot only or is perhaps an introspective excursion for Kennedy himself. If it is, the 30 year old loser wins in the end, so Kenned can be seen as optimistic at best. If there seem to be too many suicide or death jokes in the movie, perhaps Kennedy is recognizing his failure and subtly suggesting something to the audience, were all ears. Ultimately, the audience is left wishing that Kennedy's character had not come out of a coma, or at least that they could be put into one for the remainder of the film."
"10782_0.txt",400,"But before you chalk this up to being just the ramblings of a madman, a child or both, I would like to assure you that I am a 24 year old male with a broad sense of humor. I can't believe The Master of Disguise got such harsh reviews. It opened in Denmark nearly a year after it did in America so I had plenty of opportunities to read the bad reviews. But I decided to ignore them and to form my own opinion. I went to see it with my sister and I genuinely liked it. Word must have got around, because we were the only ones there, but on the other hand it was one of the smaller theaters in a multiplex cinema on a workday. Actually it added to the whole experience because we could laugh as loud as we wanted. And boy, did we laugh. There were so many funny scenes like The Turtle bit and the all too specific pop-up book, not to mention the slapping dummy. I especially enjoyed the references to other movies like when Grandfather Disguisey shows up Father Merrin style or when Pistachio shows up at Bowman's party disguised as Tony Montana. Another thing I liked was the cameos by for instance Bo Derek. I thought it was a great movie. The characters were both well cast and acted, furthermore I found that all the jokes were well carried out and none of them fell flat, not even Devlin Bowman's flatulence. It's nearly impossible to miss with a good fart joke.<br /><br />What can I say? Sometimes you just can't rely on critics. I can't wait to see Malibu's Most Wanted. I know it too got some harsh reviews but I don't care. I've seen the trailer and it looks good to me. I'm going. Even if it doesn't open in the Danish theaters."

"25986_0.txt",402,"More acutely than I've experienced in a long time, this film captures the process of personality inheritance within families. The interaction/influence between Bernard and Walt is almost painful to watch at times, but it's completely rich. Beyond just that father/son dynamic, the story is so poignant without ever getting sappy - a true accomplishment for a family drama involving divorce. Nothing hits you over the head. Nothing seems too forced. While there's plenty of confusion, discomfort, and alienation, a sense of love shines through, and I couldn't help but get attached to all of the characters. I recommend this film unconditionally."
"32050_0.txt",403,"I must say I was not expecting to like this movie but I did. My husband buys low budget films all the time and I don't like them. I was busy on my pc and halfway through the movie became drawn into it. The end was the best, it actually struck a cord with me. No other film has spoken to me in this way. It has helped me to feel comfortable in my space of being an educated-accomplished-determined at-home-mom. My biggest critique is that the film does seem incredibly slow at moments, and some of the actors were not good. Boris was great of course! Overall its soo worth sitting through for all you educated broke entrepreneur spirit filled moms out there waiting for your big break and not existing fully in the moment. Good soundtrack. Yellow Teeth. People with an older baby that can't change a diaper. Close shots. Great story. Real people. Excellent message."
"1836_0.txt",404,"I saw this in the video store last night and the cover stated that this is the movie that influenced Tarantino's Kill Bill. After watching the film I think that the only way this could have influenced Tarantino is if he watched it and then said ""this is terrible, I bet I can do this a million times better"" and then did it a million times better.<br /><br />I can't believe how high this movie is rated. Of course there's no accounting for taste and everyone has his/her own opinion but this is not a movie that should be rated 8.3/10. I give this movie 2 out of 10, only because there are worst movies out there.<br /><br />It is clear I did not like this movie. People are talking about great direction and editing, good cinematography techniques and stuff like that. They must have seen a different movie because I didn't see anything like that. In most of the scenes the camera was out of focus, the picture was blurry and whenever a handheld camera was used I felt like I was in a boat in the ocean in the middle of a violent storm (ok I'm exaggerating but you get the idea). My eyes actually hurt at some point.<br /><br />Now about the story<br /><br />**********WARNING - SPOILERS ************<br /><br />The story wasn't bad, especially the whole inner confrontation part, but it still left a lot to be desired. And the fact that there are some major holes in the script doesn't help either. Basically the story goes like this. 3 men and a woman murder a young woman's husband an then take her and torture and rape her for three days. One of them takes the woman with him and after a while she kills him for what he had done to her. She then sets out to kill the rest of the gang but is arrested and sent to prison. In prison she gives birth to a girl and we learn from the start that this girl only exists to avenge her mother. The girl begins training to be able to get revenge and after 20 years she sets out to find and kill the 3 remaining people that wronged her mother. <br /><br />The first man Lady Snowblood kills is one of the 3 villains she has devoted her life to killing. Wait, no, he is just a gang leader whith no connection to the story whatsoever that just happens to be there. As she kills him she says that this is his punishment for the crimes he commited against people. So she is a vigilante out to punish criminals? But from that point onward everything we see suggests that her sole purpose is the punishment of the people that wronged her mother. Her whole life is devoted to this. So her first kill has no purpose and is totally out of place. Maybe they just needed one more action scene.<br /><br />In search of the villains, she goes to a village in order to ask the village head about the whereabouts of the 3 people she is looking for. As soon as he says he probably can't help her she starts begging(!!!). Ok, maybe this is supposed to show her softer side but, in my opinion, a woman who is portrayed as a demon, not belonging to this world, and has devoted her whole life into becoming a killing machine in order to get her revenge, wouldn't beg in such a manner. Anyway, he finally agrees to help her.<br /><br />So they find the first of the three and after Lady Snowblood saves his life she kills him herself. He has a daughter who, of course, wants revenge too. But this won't be dealt with till the very end. Then they locate the second villain but Lady Snowblood finds out that he has died and won't be able to kill him herself. She takes it out on his grave but this is noticed by a man who was there and he starts searching for her to find out what was this all about. When he confronts her it turns out he is the owner of a local newspaper and wants to write her story but she tells him to forget it and leave her alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the next scene shows us the newspaper being printed with details of Lady Snowblood's quest. How did he find out? Well, he probably read the script. Actually people close to the heroine give him the story in order to set a trap for the last remaining villain - the woman. They explain to lady Snowblood that they know this newspaper man well and trust him. In fact they know him for more than 10 years, yet nobody knows that he is the son of the second villain that is supposed to be dead. I guess they know him really well.<br /><br />Anyway, the trap works and the woman that they are searching for comes out of hiding. Lady Snowblood tries to kill her, she escapes, and while searching for her they find her hanging from the ceiling. So it seems revenge has been exacted but soon after we find out that the second villain who was supposed to be dead is actually alive. He goes to the newspaper man - who turns out to be his son - to tell him just that: that he is alive. Well that isn't a big surprise - it could not be any other way if Lady Snowblood is to fulfill her life's purpose - what is a big surprise is that a man who staged his own death and knows there is a woman out to get him just comes out of hiding to inform a man, who is obviously close to his enemy, that he is alive. He even tells him where he lives so that they don't waste time searching for him. <br /><br />Then we go to the grand finale where the newspaper man sacrifices himself for Lady Snowblood to kill his father. And as Lady Snowblood leaves the building the first villain's daughter appears out of nowhere (how on earth did she know where to find her?) and kills her. THE END.<br /><br />Throughout the movie characters which seemingly played a big part in the heroine's life just pop up out of nowhere (like the lady who trained Lady Snowblood to be a thief) and are as easily dismissed seconds later. And the worst part of it is than even the action scenes weren't any good. Short, void of any special skill, just plain boring. And Lady Snowblood doesn't convince that she is able to handle a sword - let alone be a killing machine. <br /><br />This is the first time I feel compelled to write so many bad things about a movie. I usually try to find redeeming qualities in just about any movie I watch but this one has close to none. In short, avoid this movie. I'm certain there are much better movies with the same theme out there (come to think of it ANY movie with a similar theme is bound to be better than this one)."
"49039_0.txt",405,"I really hate this film, which is something I have never said about any other movie. I was ready to walk out on this film within the first 5 minutes. The only reason I didn't was because I had already handed over my hard earned money to see it. The story was complete rubbish, a mix of tired and unfunny spoofs of other films. Poor acting and casting decisions as well as some really bad jokes. If any film was going to kill off the spoof genre, this was going to be it. It is a great shame, because Leslie Nielsen has made some great films, none better that Flying High(Airplane) and The Naked Gun. There are no redeeming features in this movie at all so if you see it on a shelf in a video store, do yourself a favour and keep walking."

It certainly sends out a true message of hope & love for all of mankind. That everyone and anyone can experience the true ultimate gift. I know it will touch the heart of all who watch it and give hope to everyone out their that a persons heart can really change when love, which is given to us by God because He first loved us, is practiced and felt in our lives.

"4040_0.txt",407,"I can't believe this isn't in the top 50 thrillers of all time. Die Hard is a big budget action movie, with sophistication. Alan Rickman, who plays the film's German uber-baddie, really controls the part and brings in some blunt wit. Die Hard is the best and probably most violent of the trilogy. Endlessly entertaining and effortlessly rewatchable, Die Hard is a classic. 8.2 out of 10."
"865_0.txt",408,"Being a fan of cyberflics like Hackers and The Net, and having a thing for movies based on Tom Clancy novels, I thought this movie was sure to be a winner. Too bad it turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen; the kind that gives me a new-found respect for movies that I thought were bad before. Seriously. This movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever.<br /><br />Where do I start? Let's go with plot. It's unbelievably boring, from start to finish. Not only that, but it's hopelessly confusing, with new characters being introduced every 2 seconds, so you can't keep all of them straight. Plus, the plot is so unrealistic and cheezy, I found myself frequently rolling my eyes. The endless baricade of cliches doesn't help any. I could guess what was coming next at almost every part of the movie.<br /><br />The acting was just plain awful. Everyone did a terrible job of portraying emotions, or lack thereof. It was often hard to tell if they were even trying to do a good job.<br /><br />I wanted to kick the man in charge of filming the movie nearly every other scene. Nearly 75% of the movie is shot with what appears to be an 8mm videocamera rather than movie film. This is probably the biggest mistake, as it only adds to the shoddy atmosphere, making it look like a home movie rather than a commercial production.<br /><br />I never turn off a movie before it is finished, even if it is really bad. This is because there is always the possibility that the movie will suddenly get good, and I fall in love with it (which has happened before quite a few times). Actually, the final action scene was almost half-good. However, it was too little, too late. If the producers of this film expected one semi-decent scene to make up for 3 hours of crap, they are utterly mistaken.<br /><br />Fortunately, some good things can come from this movie. It makes a nifty doorstop, paperweight, and doggy chew toy.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to.. absolutely no one. If you come across a Netforce tape, drop it onto the floor and smash it by jumping on it repeatedly. Afterwards, be sure to grind your heel into it.<br /><br />I give this movie a 1 out of 10."
"25882_0.txt",409,"This was a great special. It is similar to The Muppet Show, since it took place at the same theater, but all of the segments had to do with movies, there were two guest stars instead of one (only a small number of Muppet Show episodes had multiple guests, and those were either married celebrity couples or special groups of entertainers), and there didn't seem to be any backstage plot.<br /><br />This was made in 1981, around the time that The Muppet Show was ending, and it seems to be a promotion for The great Muppet Caper disguised as a regular special, as it features three clips from The Great Muppet Caper as well as a new version of the song Hey, a Movie! However, it is really good.<br /><br />Dudley Moore and Lily Tomlin are the guest stars, and some of the segments include a medley of Wizard of Oz songs (Long before The Muppets Wizard of Oz) with Miss Piggy as Dorthy, Scooter as the Scarecrow, Gonzo as The Tin Man, Fozzie as The Cowardly Lion, and Foo Foo as Toto. There is also a Casablanca parody with Kermit and Miss Piggy, a Tarzan parody with Gonzo and Lily Tomplin, a Muppet version of The Three Muskateers (with Gonzo, Scooter, and Link Hogthrob), and a foreign film translated by Sam The Eagle and starring The Swedish Chef and Beaker.<br /><br />All in all, a great special, and I sure hope that it becomes available on DVD some day."
"41025_0.txt",410,"True story: before watching this film, one thing lead to another and I ended up dropping the disk down the toilet. Naturally, I wasn't pleased and after drying it out, I hoped it would still work. As it happens, it did work; but ironically, it turns out that down the bog was actually the best place for it. Needless to say, The Devil's Rain is an atrociously terrible slice of Satanism that isn't even saved by some extremely trashy 'melting' scenes. The plot actually isn't that bad - at least not by trash flick standards - but it's not well used and the resulting film feels messy and like it could have been so much more. The plot focuses on a group of Satan worshippers who have the power to call for rain, which melts people. The leader of this group is a man named Jonathan Corbis. He spends all his free time looking for an old book stolen by the Preston family. After tracking down the family and killing the father (with his rain), Corbin focuses his attention on the son, Mark Preston.<br /><br />The most surprising thing about this film is the cast. The Devil's Rain features a handful of performances from good, established performers...and it kind of makes you wonder what they were thinking when they signed up. Ernest Borgnine stands out the most in his role as Jonathan Corbis, but it's for all the wrong reasons. Borgnine is pure ham as the leader of the Satanic cult, and ends up looking silly with goat horns at the end! William Shatner also makes an appearance as the good guy and the rest of the cast is filled out by the likes of Tom Skerritt, Ida Lupino and John Travolta, in a small early role. The film is fairly gory and doesn't hold back with the melting scenes; but it all feels very silly and therefore doesn't make much an impact. The fact that the scenes where people aren't melting are boring doesn't exactly help things either. The plot is barely given any weight, and the tagline's claim of 'Absolutely the most incredible ending of any motion picture' seems only to be referring to Borgnine looking like a fool! Overall, this might appeal to some people...but it didn't do anything for me!"
"39240_0.txt",411,"Raoul Walsh does his usual yeoman-like job of directing this mediocre Western with Joel McRae as an outlaw trying to make one last big haul by robbing a train, Dorothy Malone as the young woman he thinks he loves, and Virginia Mayo as the girl who is, as he finally realizes, made for him.<br /><br />Walsh also directed the original story, ""High Sierra"", with Humphrey Bogart, Joan Leslie, and Ida Lupino in the same roles. ""Colorado Territory"" absconds with the story but leaves John Huston's felicitous script behind as scraps.<br /><br />Walsh has never directed a dull film, and this isn't dull. What it is, is simple minded. All of the subtlety and ambiguity that made the original so fine, so artful, is discarded and instead the characters and their motives are simplified to the extent that any particularly aware third-grader can grasp them.<br /><br />What I mean is -- how should I put this? Maybe I can make the point by giving an example. In ""High Sierra"", Bogart meets a simple, kind old man with a crippled grand-daughter who needs an operation. That's the teen-aged Joan Leslie we're talking about, and, man, she looks good, though rendered sullen by her disability. Bogart comes into some loot and gives much of it to Joan Leslie's family so that she can have her operation. Meanwhile, he falls in with Ida Lupino, a whore who has been kicked around, loves Bogart, and will do anything for him. Before adopting Lupino, Bogart tells her that there's no place in his life for her. (He's thinking of settling down with Joan Leslie once she's fixed up.) Leslie's operation is a success and from her recovery bed she showers Bogart with gratitude -- but not love, as she explains to Grampa. On his next visit, Bogart finds her drinking and jitterbugging frenetically with a boyfriend. Leslie is still grateful to Bogart but she rejects his possessiveness, and he leaves her forever with Ida Lupino. Huston and Walsh fill these scenes with love, ambiguity, a frantic hope and a hopeless remorse.<br /><br />In the remake, the Joan Leslie figure, Dorothy Malone, has nothing wrong with her except that she is greedy and treacherous. Although McRae gives the family enough money to start their farm, Malone tries to alert the sheriff to MacRae's presence in order to collect the twenty-thousand-dollar reward. The Ida Lupino character, Virginia Mayo, actually has to have a physical fight with Malone to keep her from rushing out the door. There is no ambiguity, no sense of real life. Malone is not a nice, if slightly empty-headed girl, who wants to just enjoy her new freedom. She's a bad girl.<br /><br />""Colorado Territory"" is miscast, as well. Joel McRae is a good light comedian or light action star -- a nice guy. He's not the tough ex-con that Bogart was. And Virginia Mayo is supposed to be part Pueblo Indian, though she looks about as Indian as Jean Harlow, the heavy makeup notwithstanding. One of the most touching (because grounded) elements of the original is that Bogart had to give up the vivacious young Joan Leslie for the older, husky, used, and rather plain Ida Lupino. In the remake, the succulent Virginia Mayo of 1949 could give Dorothy Malone a run for her money any day. It's like a high-schooler having to give up his romance with the head of the girl's cheer-leading squad for the love of the Prom Queen. There's not much of a sense of loss.<br /><br />I've picked out just one set of relationships to compare, but any viewer could easily spot a dozen more in which the original is superior to the remake. (Humphrey Bogart, describing what a Tommy gun sounds like, taps his finger three times on the desk and says, ""Tap tap tap. That's all."" Nothing like that here.) Nice location shooting, but if you want to see a movie made for adult sensibilities, rent the original. This remake is pretty watered down."

What part of hot college chicks from another planet led you to believe this was going to be Schindler's List?! Obviously, the people who made this movie meant it to be goofy (DUH!). Too bad you can't lighten up and just enjoy the silly film that it was clearly made to be. It's entertainment. Mindless fun. Stop taking yourselves so seriously.

"21744_0.txt",413,"Australian filmmaker Elissa Down's THE BLACK BALLOON is a thoughtful film, down to earth with no apology in depicting a close-knit family of four (Toni Collette as Mom who is pregnant with a fifth member coming, Erik Thomson as Dad whose army life demanded constant moving, and two teenage sons: Luke Ford as Charlie the autistic one who is older in age but not in behavior, and Rhys Wakefield as baby-face Thomas in his uneasy growing teen period) - taking on living with autistic challenges everyday (sometimes by the moment).<br /><br />It is a coming of age story revolving around 17-year old Thomas, how he deals with the people around him: his brother Charlie, Mom and Dad, schoolmates, new friends and neighbors. There is more than meets the eye. Thomas seems to be battling inner conflicts, dilemmas he's reluctant to confront: ""Will Charlie ever be normal?"" he asked. ""Charlie is not my problem,"" he shouted. Mom and Dad are both very patient and tolerant. The family's togetherness is very much held by a determined mother (again, brilliantly portrayed by Toni Collette) that would not 'give up' on her eldest, and Charlie is treated just like any child having his (normal) tantrums and (unpredictable) antics. As the film progresses, we feel for Thomas' frustration with Charlie, and welcome the relief of his delights with popular girl at school, Jackie (Gemma Ward gave an endearing portrayal) who has no problem hanging out with both Thomas and Charlie. She (from a single-Dad family) accepted Charlie with equal normalcy and seemed to fit into Thomas' family rather well.<br /><br />Like any family life, there are turn of events: Mom has to be 'confined to bed' at the hospital prior to birth of baby, so Dad and Thomas are left with the charge to handling Charlie's day to day needs - a learning curve that Thomas didn't expect. Through the ups and downs (Thomas' driving lesson with Dad in his car, Thomas' birthday family celebration 'blow out' with Jackie present), anguish and laughter (yes, that happens, if only we can laugh it off and let go more often), a new family member did arrive, and at Charlie's school performance, Thomas had his coming of age challenges and came through understanding his brother Charlie more. Director Down spares us no 'mushy' sentiments or Hollywood 'feel good' pressures - she delivered a bold and assured script (co-written with Jimmy Jack, telling like it is from her personal experience with two autistic brothers) and gave us a film we can appreciate the possible family warmth that can be steadfastly generated in challenging circumstances. ""The Black Balloon"" has hardly the hint of a debut feature from a talented filmmaker to watch, Elissa Down. The casting of Luke Ford and Rhys Wakefield paired as the two brothers is a godsend, indeed. Convincing performances all round.<br /><br />Enjoy also the interesting opening credits: at the corner of your eyes, you could notice there are 'extraneous' words or obvious name labels of things within each frame, e.g., grass, sky, wall, jeans, fence - as the credits roll on. Ah, it's for the sake of Charlie, the autistic brother and the rest of the family, too."
"22217_0.txt",414,"Neither the prospect of eighty minutes of biting headwind nor snow showers has been able to keep me from the National Film Theatre over the three weeks so far of its Buster Keaton season, and every time the films have yet to disappoint: ""Battling Butler"" is no exception! I'd instantly give this a 9 if only I could justify it relative to the early scenes; despite the pitch of enthusiasm I'd reached by the end of the film, I'm still not quite sure in all fairness that I can.<br /><br />It definitely takes a while to get up to speed (at the start, I took the father to be a doctor giving his sickly son only three months to live!) and for the initial reel or so it depends largely on a single extended gag -- the elegant fop's complete unsuitability for an outdoor environment. Alfred's elaborate al-fresco living arrangements echo Keaton's trademark fascination with complicated contrivances, and there's one very typical bit of misdirection where we wait for the shotgun's recoil to knock Alfred backwards into the water, only for a somewhat different turn of events to prove his downfall; but this film doesn't come properly to life until its hero engages our sympathy as well as being a walking joke. In ""The General"", we engage with Johnnie Gray almost immediately -- in ""Battling Butler"", Alfred remained a cipher for me until the moment when he nervously rehearses ""Beatrice Faircatch""'s newspaper advice on making a proposal, with such an earnest air: it's funny, but it's also touching, and it's no coincidence that it is with his subsequent first steps towards standing on his own two feet -- tearing up and throwing aside the useless newspaper column -- that Alfred Butler may finally be said to have progressed beyond a simple one-dimensional character, and the film can really begin.<br /><br />From here on the picture becomes a Keaton classic, sweeping the hapless hero further and further from the cushioned normality of his life with a series of escalating and plausible coincidences. Ultimately the worm will turn, of course -- but not in the time and manner that we are expecting. And Keaton acts here not just with that famous face but with every line of his whole body: triumph, exhaustion, despair, apprehension, indignation, timidity, pugnacity... and finally, in the last scene, sublime confidence in his own skin, modelling a costume so incongruous that only Buster Keaton could carry it off with such genuine elegance! <br /><br />The scenes of Alfred's ordeal are hilarious and moving by degrees -- it's almost impossible to analyse Keaton's appeal. 'Sweet' is quite definitely the wrong word, as is 'lovable': Buster is no Little Tramp. 'Bittersweet' might be closer to the mark... or 'poignant'; the metaphor of the man who gets knocked down but keeps on trying has never been more apt. There is a brief vivid moment when Alfred, bewildered and worn out, turns his face aside into the arms of his second with such a hopeless little air that instead of a laugh, it raised a murmur of pity from the auditorium. But Keaton never allows himself to milk the audience for sympathy -- the best of his films may mingle laughter through tears, but he never falls into the trap of sentimentality.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is among the best of Keaton's films... but it's certainly one of those I've ultimately enjoyed the most so far. I've changed my mind: I'll give it a 9 after all, and say I'm dropping a mark down instead from a 10! :-)"
"12970_0.txt",415,"I'm not kidding. This was a really funny, surprisingly thought-provoking movie. I had to watch it for work (yeah, really), and I thought it was well-shot, well-written, well-acted, and hilarious. The only thing I didn't like was the title. It didn't convey the singularity of the film as being a completely unexpected take on the rite of the bachelor party. I guess people who hated it missed the message -- yes, message. And the fat jokes and elderly jokes et cetera were tongue-in-cheek. Superficial characteristics are easy targets, and that is exactly the point of this movie. I'm wondering if some of these reviewers stopped watching before the end. Somehow, I kept watching because I had a sense that wherever this movie was going, it was not going in your average mindless direction. And it was a fun ride. I'm going to watch Eric Bernt more closely now."
"30958_0.txt",416,"A very good movie! First, the plot listed is incorrect. He does not escape from a prison in Alabama, but rather the state prison in Huntsville, Texas, (the author apparently got their ""Huntsvilles"" mixed up and assumed it was Alabama.) There is, in fact, a prison in Huntsville, TX, and the entire movie takes place in Texas & Mexico. A lot of action, albeit, the plot's outcome is apparent throughout. Still, this movie has an outstanding cast for a low-budget film and the original music by John Schneider is excellent. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of Kirk Douglas, John Schneider, or just your average action-movie-without-all-the-big-time-Hollywood-promotion stuff. I would say it is along the lines of movies such as ""Lone Wolf McQuade"", ""Hunter's Blood"", or ""Avenging Force"", all great movies without a lot of hype!"

Although it's been years since I saw this film, and it's not available anywhere in the States (although I did see a copy in a Sydney video rental place...anyone wanna sell me one?) I distinctly recall Michael Hutchence's gloomy smackhead character experiencing THE most realistic acid trip at a party I've ever seen on film (and trust me, that's sayin something).

"18834_0.txt",419,"When I saw the advertisement in TVGuide for this animation it was touted as an original work by Randkin and Bass. It so happened that the original TV airing in '56 with Basil Rathbone in the lead was a fond memory, especially the music. The original show featured Rathbone as Scrooge and a great cast of 50's names including Vic Damone, Patrice Munsel, Johnny Desmond and many other talents. The re-make in the seventies featured some great personalities as well but did not have the charm of the original broadcast live on the Alcoa Theater. Hearing Rathbone sing was unique. The other talents speak for themselves. I guess I really objected to the claim that the '70s production was an original work. I guess they thought that the original was a faded memory. Perhaps, since it was live and there is no video or film of the original to keep. The songs are exactly the same as they were in the '56 production but without the same charm."
"45106_0.txt",420,"Lady In The Lake (3 out of 10)<br /><br />Phillip Marlowe movies marry us to the detective's point of view. He is in every scene, and we never see what happens behind his back.

The majority of the movie is Marlowe's P.O.V. -- the camera shakes when he gets slapped around, and ""our"" eyes close when he kisses the girl. No Stedicam, of course, so the camerawork is pretty stiff, but not nearly as stiff as the acting.<br /><br />The Raymond Chandler plot is as good as you might expect, and I allowed myself to accept the gimmick; however, the acting is worse than I have ever seen in any A-movie of the studio system. Beyond horrible. Did the actors feel silly talking to the camera? <br /><br />Lila Leeds is stunning in her brief turn as a receptionist.

"33115_0.txt",421,"I expected so much more from Mick Malloy and Glen Robbins. This movie was definitely a 'cringer'. The plot was thin, the humor was weak, immature and unchecked - like little boys laughing at their own jokes. As a woman I was offended, not so much by the lyrics themselves, but by the concept that women in general would be entertained by such rubbish. On the more positive side, I felt that 1980's style film clips were effective and realistic. I quite enjoyed the contemporary BoyTown film clips and would have appreciated lyrics with intelligent humor. The acting was good, filming effective. I would definitely not put this in the same class as The Dish, The Castle or Crackerjack."

"32396_0.txt",423,"Set in South Florida's world of models, pools, beaches, drugs, gangsters and nightclubs this is another stab at copying the success of Baywatch, but adding some sub-Miami Vice elements for that prime-time soap measure.<br /><br />It's also executive-produced by Jennifer Lopez, which explains why it looks like nothing more than one of her music videos. But despite virtually everyone on screen being stunningly good looking it's all fur coat and no knickers. Everyone is a hunk or a babe ready to flash the flesh, but nobody gets involved in anything remotely resembling a decent plot and the dialogue is flimsier than the thong bikinis some of the women wear. If that's all you need then tune in, but when it first aired in America, few did, and it ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005-06 season  and was then dropped after eight episodes.<br /><br />In LA last year I found myself on the beach where Baywatch was once filmed. It was 10am and few others were about so I ran along the sand in slow motion, just like 'The Hoff' used to do. Then I noticed that coming the other way was someone else doing exactly the same thing. We laughed, and (slowly) carried on our way. Baywatch might have been corny but it was a guilty pleasure loved by millions because it was light-hearted fun. South Beach will only have people running for the remote control, and almost certainly not in slow motion."
"39849_0.txt",424,"This movie is currently remembered for one scene...the infamous scene where one of the worst actors of all time spouts out the line ""GARBAGE DAY!"" and proceeds to shoot a man and let out horrible fake laughs. Though that scene is hilarious and all, this movie needs to be remembered for more. Eric Freeman, the film's lead actor, has created a monster, and his acting is so bad, perhaps it deserves to go down as worst ever. I've seen many films considered the worst, but never was the acting this unconvincing and bad. It must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Ricky Caldwell (Eric Freeman) is in an insane asylum, but is let in to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Henry Bloom (James Newman). Ricky tells the Doc everything of his past, even events he wasn't present during and clearly would have no real way of knowing what happened. We learn about Ricky's brother, who the first film is about, then after half the movie flashing back to the first film, we get to know Ricky and how he became so psychotic. But after Ricky escapes from the room he's telling the story in, there's gonna' be trouble for whoever gets in his path.<br /><br />This movie is so full of plot holes it's ridiculous. Ricky flashes back to the first film in vivid details, and literally over 20 minutes of the film are just long scenes from the first movie. How he knows what happened to his brother makes no sense. In one scene he flashes back to when he was a newborn baby, because, of course, vivid memories are easy to keep for a baby. Even when his flashbacks are of new footage, they're still boring, and extremely poorly acted. Eric Freeman acts like he's a robot or something. His words come out in strange patterns, like he's trying to read the words for the first time off a teleprompter as he performs. It's really that bad.<br /><br />Ricky flashes back to the girl he loved. The writers didn't even try to give them any sort of connection. The first scene she's introduced, seconds later they're making love. They only speak in two scenes, and in neither scene does he show any sort of affection towards her.<br /><br />The climax of the film is also the last ten minutes, and the only part of the film that doesn't take place in the asylum or in flashback. And speaking of asylum, how did Ricky escape? He just walked out. That makes no sense. But anyways, back to the plot. When Ricky escapes he goes for the Mother Superior, who is supposed to be the same as in the first film, but now she looks completely different and resembles Two-Face from Batman. Ricky chases the Mother around her apartment, which happens to be 666 (These writers are geniuses). The Mother Superior is in a wheelchair! And then Ricky shouts ""Moooooo!"". Possibly this line was meant to be Boooo, but he clearly says ""Moooooo!"" It's so ridiculously stupid!<br /><br />The script to this is so bad. Limiting your knowledge of the film to ""Garbage Day!"" is a shame, because this film really has some gem lines and really bad readings. Thanks for the worst part of this film goes to the lead, Eric Freeman and his overly expressive and always moving eyebrows which each deserve their own film. This movie's godawful, but full of what seems to be unintentional humor in the acting. It's hard to believe director Lee Harry wasn't laughing out loud while directing this thing, it's that bad.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB out of ****. 88 mins. R for violence, language and sex."
"29711_0.txt",425,"Man, what a time to grow up! The 1980's were a fabulous time for, not only, music, and films, but television as well. There was no better television station in the 1980's than The USA Network! USA ""Up All Night"" was amazing! Since I was too young to really go out, and party, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, I would sit at home, or at a friends house and watch this show every weekend. I loved how atrocious the 'B' movies were, and the hilarious comments both Gilbert Godfried and Rhonda Shear used to make about the film.<br /><br />USA's late night television blocks were AMAZING on weekends. I can vividly remember getting excited, every Saturday, from about 1988-1993, to watch The USA Network from 8PM until, at least 3AM.<br /><br />As a teenager that loved horror films, what could've been better than USA's Saturday Nightmares block (8PM-11PM) and then, USA ""Up All Night"" which ran from 11PM-3AM. Blood and guts from 8-11 and T&A from 11PM-3AM, what could've been better for a 13 year old guy? LOL! Unfortunately, The USA Network, like many other television stations, has gotten stale, and play many syndicated television shows, which are boring as hell. I will never forget all of the great childhood memories, I received from The USA Network from 1987 until 1993.<br /><br />If there could only be a ""USA Network Classic"" channel created, that could run these old shows, in their original form, including retro USA bumpers. Shows like ""Night Flight"", ""Up All Night"", ""Saturday Nightmares"", and ""Commander USA's Groovy Movies"" that would kick some serious ass!"

It is a very disturbing and powerful film about men mostly Scottish who are taken prisoner by the Japs in World War 2, and are tortured and forced to build a railroad to India on very little food. The movie is filled with great little things as well as all the great big things, my favorite is that one of the characters in called.

A&C's new contract with Universal allowed them one independent production a year, and ""Noose"" was it. Not part of the Universal package when their films were syndicated to television, ""Noose"" has fallen through the cracks and is one of their least familiar films to moviewatchers.

Even though Elizabeth Bainbridge was a very dignified Dame Carruthers, her character was perhaps meant to be a bit more of a gorgon. But her approach worked in general. Sets and costumes were excellent.<br /><br />Apart from missing the ensemble ""Strange Adventure"" I thought the music was well served.

The plot is simple - the titular characters fall in love, clichéd plot devices pull them apart, before getting back together for a feel-good ending. All wonderfully bland and formulaic.<br /><br />The only difference here is that there is a variety of interesting (but pointless) side-characters and subplots around them, sometimes genuinely good as individual scenes but always jarringly disjointed.<br /><br />And here is the film's main fault: there is a lot of potential within the quirky neighbours, but they are reduced to little more than unrelated vignettes that simply distract from the main story.<br /><br />By themselves, unrelated vignettes would have been fine - as would a bland romance.<br /><br />But by mixing the two, director Robert Gediguian creates an unappetising sludge that is messy, meandering and boring - a crime with such potentially interesting characters to explore."

The film is equally enchanting, and the director manages to spoof a spirited performance from the lovely Kate Maberly. Haydn Prowse was great as Colin, and John Lynch is suitably melancholy as the uncle. Stealing the show, however, was Maggie Smith as Mrs Medlock, the truly beastly housekeeper. The film itself looks beautiful thanks to the stunning cinematography, and I loved the Gothic darkness tone retained from the book.

I only managed to catch this movie on TV a couple of months and it would be suffice to say I was very disappointed. I think most of the blame should fall on Sajid Khan, don't get me wrong I think he is hilarious in five minutes sketches but he can't make people laugh for three hours. The main problem is that Sajid Khan couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to make Hey Babyy a comedy or a drama, which results in an uneasy mix of both. As a result of that the film fails on both counts, it doesn't make you laugh and it didn't me cry. Now onto the best aspect of Hey Babyy, the songs are tremendous, my favourites being Jaane bhi de and Mast Kalandar(which has a guest appearance by Shah Rukh Khan).

However, being a fan of both Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson, i was disappointed with their roles. I felt embarrassed for Timothy Hutton, a superb actor looking tired in a pitiful part.

At the center are two men, Angel and Nene, characters sharing an extraordinary bond of love, implicit in two ways: one, in that their sexual identity is repressed, and two, that the viewer never witnesses sex in its explicit form between the two. The two struggle to understand just where they fit: Nene, taking in his sexual company a lonely prostitute, and Angel, grappling with Nene's apparent refusal of him by shooting up heroin, nearly dying as a result of his amorous devotion. In a nod to Hollywood cinema, Marcelo Piñeyro focuses on the action just as much as he focuses on the relationship of two men, who call themselves Los Mellizos, or the twins. Like its name implies, Burnt Money appears to signify loss, or losing the value of something or someone. Marcelo Piñeyro suppresses the explicit relationship and the erotic routine from the viewer's eyes. It's almost as if he himself wants to break away from the tradition of thinking that gay love is always overtly evident. Scene after scene, the incredible excruciation of being in love is honorably, even horrifically evident, such as in the scene where Nene tenderly takes to the bullet in his lover, Angel's side; whose agonized screams are shrill as well as painful. Burnt Money is a movie that society should be interested in, because it shows how first impressions are almost always incorrect. By the end of the movie, the audience realizes for itself how living in a materialistic culture affects their understanding of the film. This movie is not for the viewer with a preconceived or pessimistic notion of homosexuality, or one who is easily turned away from overt sexuality, as it appears elsewhere in the film. It's inconceivable to think of a love surviving amidst chaos, yet explicitly evident by the film's conclusion are two characters gleefully and explicitly demonstrating their devotion; a scene where the two burn the money that they stole, and that which their pursuers are after."

I am not sure if it has been released publicly or just because it was filmed where I presently live. It cracks me up that with all the phenomenal scenery - it was attributed to Arizona. (It was actually filmed in Southern Utah(Hurricane) - I went to the school they attended - its been torn down since) I was fascinated by the fact I had never HEARD of this movie.It was outstanding. Action packed - thrilling - touching - and yet realistic. It was awesome to see the reaction of children in the theater as well - they seem to feel along with the boys! THis was perfect for all ages - young to old - and impressive from start to finish. This may have been one of the best movies I have seen all year!"

Or so they think.<br /><br />Redford plays Martin Bishop, who has been on the run from the law since 1969, when his friend Cosmos was caught hacking into some large bank accounts - like the Republican Party's, Richard Nixon's, etc. Bishop (whose name back then was Brice) was outside the building at the time and has been wanted ever since. Fast forward 20+ years and he's a securities expert in partnership with ex-CIA agent Poitier, Ackroyd, the blind Strathairn, and River Phoenix.

A decoder that can get into power plants, the Federal Reserve, and every other important place.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, entertaining movie that has both funny and highly suspenseful moments. The story is way out there, the technical equipment is interesting and lots of it probably still holds up 16 years later, and the cast is great. I realize some of the comments are quite negative - I find ""Sneakers"" very enjoyable with great ensemble work and an intricate plot. Realistic? Is Mission: Impossible?

"32074_0.txt",445,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.<br /><br />A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.<br /><br />The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday"" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical.

"35655_0.txt",450,"1st watched 1/6/2007 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Alan Metter): Mostly un-funny attempt by Rodney Dangerfield to carry a movie with his bad jokes, bad taste but somewhat charming elderly man trying to do things the way he knows how film. The movie tries to pull off the fact that he has a good heart in the end which pulls the movie up a little bit but not enough for me to recommend it. This is basically the story of a man who's made it in life the hard way without even a high school diploma but decides to follow in his kid's footsteps and tries to attend college himself to help his boy's attitude after he hands divorce papers to his second wife. He starts out doing it the way he knows how -- by buying people and getting others to do the hard work but is caught by the college authorities and has to shape up. Dangerfield & a young Robert Downey Jr. are good for a couple of laughs but that's about it, so it was a nice try but this comic can't carry an entire movie with his schtick, and the basic boy meets girl premises added into the mix for both himself and his son doesn't help the movie much either."

The only thing truly Lovecraftian about it was the small touch of Negrophobia in it. *Sad but true; HPL was a closet racist. Just read ""Call of Cthulu!""* I guess the nicest touch was the subtle homage to a similar anthology: the British b/w classic ""Dead of Night.""

"25133_0.txt",456,"Edmund Goulding's Grand Hotel is a perfect example of how a flawed film can still be great because of its blemishes, and not in spite of them. Winner of the Best Picture Academy Award of 1933 (but not even nominated in any other category), it is an indisputable classic that stands apart as one of the finest (and most timeless) motion pictures of the 30's -- which was a terrific decade for the cinema. The story structure was essentially unprecedented -- with the exception of that same year's Freaks, which was unprecedented in practically every way possible -- in that it featured multiple characters with independent relationships and intertwining narratives (in other words, it laid the groundwork for every Robert Altman film ever made -- Gosford Park in particular). Greta Garbo plays a dancer staying at a hotel along with a thief disguised as a baron (John Barrymore), a young and beautiful stenographer (Joan Crawford), a stern businessman (Wallace Beery), a fidgety social outcast trying to enjoy what's left of his life (Lionel Barrymore), and a mysterious doctor (Lewis Stone). The mysticism and coincidence of multiple people dealing with secret issues in the same location remains one of the most compelling and intriguing film techniques out there (see Todd Solondz's Happiness and P.T. Anderson's Magnolia), and it was certainly more compelling than most of what was being produced by Hollywood at the time (in spite of the fact that this WAS a great time for film, most pictures relied on very conventional and often contrived styles to achieve their popularity). So to think that the Academy once recognized such offbeat masterpieces makes you wonder what happened to them over the past few years. Even after 70+ years, Grand Hotel remains just as brilliant and fascinating as it was to begin with -- if not more: each character is as dynamic and enthralling as the next, and each frame is filled with surprises and idiosyncrasies. Perhaps Pauline Kael put it best when she wrote, ""If you want to see what screen glamour used to be, and what originally 'stars' were, this is perhaps the best example of all time."" Indeed, the stars in Grand Hotel are true stars, the foremost being Garbo: while often cited as one of the great actresses, few seem to recall how mesmerizing Garbo truly was. She hardly ever appeared to be acting, yet every gesture she made and every word she spoke was magnificently overdone -- as would have been necessary during her silent roles. And even though her beauty is far from conventional, it is truly undeniable. When first released, Crawford was notoriously frustrated that Garbo received top billing (she was rumored to have always arrived late on the set, playing Marlene Dietrich records in between cuts just because she knew they were Garbo's pet peeves), but to me this only enhances the characters: Crawford's role is supposed to be more subdued (afterall, she IS the stenographer and Garbo IS the celebrity in the film). Perhaps the most impressive performance of all is Lionel Barrymore's: as a bumbling, overly anxious everyman who has been ignored his entire life, he is completely and utterly heart-breaking; there is not a single moment when he isn't in character (and the same goes for the rest of the cast). His real-life brother John Barrymore is equally outstanding, providing a suave counterpart to Lionel's subtle melancholy. Goulding's direction is nothing short of spectacular: his innovative use of close-ups and repeated set-ups is something to be admired -- especially at a time when there was no precedent for these methods. The script (which was originally a play) is filled with both wit and insight (yet no Oscar nod?). Earlier in this review I made mention of the film's supposed flaws, and Grand Hotel is indeed far from perfect; many of the cuts are rough and uneven, and some of the plot developments come off as sudden and unbelievable, but the film is only better for it. Its faults give it an edge that would have otherwise been replaced by an overly polished look which wouldn't be nearly as compelling. All in all, Grand Hotel is an absolute masterpiece, plain and simple. Watch it and be amazed.<br /><br />Grade: A+<br /><br />(#88 on my All-Time Top 100 list.

"19156_0.txt",458,"A lot of good review comments, so I'll just add. This movie could well be classed a historical in some respects, and is actually shown in some colleges as part of curriculum. It is based on the true and personal story of Run DMC, The Fat Boys, Kurtis Blow, Sheila E, and others breaking out rap music for the first time to the mainstream audiences against convention and against those who would view rap as non-music and a fad. It showcases the music as a true underground phenomena; fun, creative, positive, and energetic; embraced by urban youth eager to rebel. Poor, fat, whatever, just being yourself for a change was enough for you to make a go of it and be successful. There are 12 musical productions in the film and some showstopper performances by Sheila E (coached by Prince for this film) especially. This movie was based on real events and the roles played by the people themselves who lived them. In that sense it may not have a Hollywood calibre cast and complicated plot, but that wasn't the point of this film. This film was meant to showcase the struggles of a music, the struggles of artists in an emerging genre, and show people where it was at in 1985. It did just that, capturing the heart and soul of hip-hop, where it all is rooted, free from excessive profanity, free from guns and gangsterism; just go out and have fun, stand tall, express yourself, forget the nay-sayers, and throw down the creativity. And the rest is history."
"18165_0.txt",459,"Although this film has hints of the chillingly mysterious horrors that are conveyed in Lovecraft's stories, in is incredibly boring, awkward and stilted. The best performance in the film is turned in by Sandra Dee, which may give you a clue about the low quality of the acting by such generally competent performers as Ed Begley and Sam Jaffe. Dean Stockwell phones in what must be the worst job of his career. The dialog is at times incoherent. The special effects abysmal. The editing, non-existent. I lay the blame for most faults squarely on the shoulders of the director, a former designer and art director on some classic horror films who seems to be well out of his area of competence here. The film clearly must have had a lowest of the low budget as well. Alas, we have yet to see a really good treatment of any Lovecraftian tale on film."
"20578_0.txt",460,"This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen. <br /><br />This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.<br /><br />Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without). <br /><br />My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one. The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick. John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day. <br /><br />The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film. <br /><br />Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course, the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films."

"35999_0.txt",463,"This sort of thing has been done many times before with bees,slugs,rats and even ticks so why not a creature feature with locusts. This is a made for TV feature starring one time butt kicking warrior princess Lucy Lawless. A swarm of genetically engineered locusts escape from a laboratory and head across America creating a swathe of destruction as they go. This may have been an interesting idea on the drawing board but it has one big problem, the locusts just don't feel threatening.In classic films such as The Birds and The Swarm you feel threatened by the creatures but in this the locusts are more likely to induce a yawn rather than any sense of panic or terror.Half way through the feature the locusts turn carnivorous and this gave me the feeling that ideas had started to run out. I know Lucy Lawless may be trying to move away from Xena but surely she could choose better vehicles for her talent than this half baked attempt at creature feature terror. The dialogue was forced, the direction was slow and probably because the locusts were CGI based they didn't even begin to bring me out in even a Luke warm sweat. I give this 4/10 and that is only because of Lucy Lawless.I will always be a Lucy Lawless fan and anything she is in deserves some sort of score. My advice to anyone out there is to avoid this feature at all costs."

Well, what I understood was that dates were not necessarily expressed in ""Terms"" and that Debra Winger's character had actually died in 1973 - with fifteen years added to Melanie's age of three when her mother died, that would account for her being a college freshman in 1988.

"314_0.txt",465,"Contemporary releases in sci-fi/horror genre prove that rich Hollywood filmmakers are running out of ideas. This film is really an excellent example of how you can do a great job with almost no money.<br /><br />The greatest thing in Screamers is that there is a message in it. It's just a way the real art should be - it should make people think, dream, use their imagination and not only consume the finished and totally digested pieces of information. And I think not many expensive Hollywood productions (especially sci-fi) are successful in this regard.<br /><br />So, for instance, the idea that someone who looks human, can be a rusted dead machine inside and you can never say who's who judging from their appearance. Or the forsaken soldiers who sacrifice their lives in a pointless war, which was forgotten by the governments who started it. Blood is cheaper than raw materials - this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.<br /><br />In my opinion you mustn't have one million explosions or world-famous stars in a movie to make it good. It's just a good story, an appropriate atmosphere and some really well done acting to make it good. And in my opinion Screamers has all these elements."

"11846_0.txt",467,"I was a bit surprised by the sometimes frank and honest dialog coming from Aoi Miyazaki's character in what for the most part is a very family friendly bit of Japanese young love/first love cinema. But it is appropriate for her character, a set-to-mature-at-any-moment young woman deficient in some necessary growth hormones needed to push her over the edge (that when triggered by a first kiss could ultimately be her ... undoing) and seems trapped in young adolescence. It's a very cute and cute-funny, and really sad, sad, film. Miyazaki teeters the edge between coy and seductive so well it made me dizzy ... with delight. I could, however, understand her pouty lipped attempts at cuteness turning some folks off. She does slip out of it each time very quickly, though. That's part of her charm, I guess.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed. The 'heavenly' forest is fairy-tale gorgeous, as are the three young actors we spend time with.

As soon as the movie had some action -- say, somebody jumped on a chair -- the cameramen went frantic. I kept vomiting during the car chase scenes, and that's pretty bad if you consider that they were driving at 10 mph with a bored frown on their faces.<br /><br />Then ugh... the acting. Not one performance even came close to being decent. The script... was there even a script? It looked like there was no story and they came up with (bad) ideas while shooting. And some scenes were so idiotic I wonder how a sane brain would came up with them. I mean, at one point Nick, the ""good friend"" of Simon Sez, has a gun in his hand, and loses it because he is making fun of the ""bad girl"" by playing a tyrannosaur. This is the kind of comedy that you don't laugh at because it's funny, you laugh at it because it's so unredeemable and idiotic you literally can't believe it. By the way, him being a tyrannosaur was as believable as Rodman being an ex-CIA agent. Hell, they even managed to make the French Coast look somewhat small and crappy!<br /><br />Oh well... 1/10"
"5163_0.txt",469,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this romp of nonsense. In fact, we're still singing that crazy ""Four Months at Sea"" song and laughing about it. Sure, it is improbable, but the actors are obviously having fun, making it such a pleasure to watch. Imagine a bunch of no-talent prisoners attempting a musical to ""please"" their warden (and escape)? Can they pull it off without killing themselves laughing at their ridiculousness? That's entirely debatable. The songs are catchy, the casting of the musical characters (think con-jobs) hilarious, the costumes.... well, see for yourself. This is one film we are planning to buy and keep. Just what is needed when stuck in lousy winter weather."
"15251_0.txt",470,"Freaks and Geeks, though unfortunately short lived, is, perhaps, the greatest show in the history of television. Like other fantastic series, this one does not fall into any distinct categories, administering equal doses of humor and pathos and tears. Each episode, really, defies all expectations. There're the uproarious episodes (like the Halloween one or the Nick Disco one) and then there's Kim Kelly is My Friend (not shown on network TV due to its subject matter) and the story arc following Neal and his dad's disintegrating relationship. Yet, even in the darkest episodes there're at least a couple belly laughs and in the funniest a couple dark moments. Feig and his writers' ability to so seamlessly blend comedy and drama into a single show reveals tremendous talent - a talent, perhaps, more suited to the big screen. That's why Freaks often seems like the greatest TV show ever; it's completely unlike TV, but it's very much like film.<br /><br />The show also rises above most of its competition due the talent of its cast. Each young actor is so convincing that I can't quite imagine them being anyone but their character. It doesn't seem like any of them are actually acting. I would expect Sam and Neal and Bill to behave like the were I to meet them tomorrow in a mall.<br /><br />The same goes with the Freaks. Watching the out-takes, though, you notice that, in fact, that is not even remotely the case. Who knew that Martin Starr (Bill) is not the hugest dork on the planet? Who knew that Busy Phillips is not a raging bitch? On every level, this show is superior to most others. The writing, the acting - even the photography (which looks like it was location shooting rather than set-shooting) - are all fantastic. It's truly a shame that this show never made it into a second season. Sure, it's better to burn out than to fade away, but the writers and actors had a few more years of this show in them. Regardless, Freaks and Geeks is an absolute masterpiece that, like Twin Peaks, the Simpsons, the Office, and most of Happy Days, shows what TV can be."
"14636_0.txt",471,"A great made after the comedy Hum Tum. Kunal have done a brilliant job. He had wrote the dialogs, the story brilliantly. I think its totally different film of Indian cinema. As bollywood freak I recommend this film to all audience even to kids too. Its has huge stars and brilliant director. Kunal gave his best even more than Hum Tum. Way to go Kunal you surely winning in this year. Nominations for sure even awards too. I believe you deserve more this year than Karan Johar from KANK. The direction you made has been the best. I even liked KANK but after I saw Fanaa I think its a way different film and making its mark separate from all films from past. The direction of Kunal has been the best direction I seen so far this year. This film should win the best-playback and direction as well. The film stars huge cast for sure. It has Rishi Kapoor whom I really adore. He is brilliant even in small role of a father. Aamir Khan is superb just superb. I can't even say in words how he gave his performance. Great comeback from KAJOL. I am a huge fan of her since I began seeing films. Kajol is the best actress ever of new generation.<br /><br />After K3G she has made a great come back. Her performance is just brilliant. Its just marvelous. She was truly character in the film. It for one second you can't say that she is not acting as blind. Her acting is better than Rani from black. I don't say Rani didn't act good but she was good but Kajol is the best in blind role. The film is a must see. When you think you know whats happening but the second next you don't. The dialogs are written brilliantly. The lyrics are just very touchy. The music is worth it that you can't even comment because it's from the soul. Sonu sang the song beautifully. The Tere haath main mera haath ho. This song is sang by Sonu Nigam beautifully. I think he should win awards this year from this song from Fanaa. The tittle song from Kank he also sang brilliantly but he sang this song even better. Yashraj are still ruling. Making the greatest movies. Bollywood awards sometimes are differ from our choices but if i was the jury I would the award for best director of this film. I would also give Sonu for best playback singer from Tere Haath mein Mera haath ho. I would also give the award for best story and dialogs . An excellent film. I am sure this film is getting many awards but these i mentioned I think it should be the winners. As far as acting Kajol is the best and should get an award too. Aamir is brilliant but I think Shah Rukh has acted better in KANK. Kirron Kher is in both so i can't say but she is not much in this film. I give this film 1000000 out of 1000000."

As I have been studying a few Cary Grant film over the past semester I wanted to watch Penny Serenade because I thought it may help an essay I am writing currently. My mother also sat down to watch with me. At the beginning I was unimpressed to be honest but as soon as the story really gets going and the drama unfolds I was hooked. I cried when Irene Dune couldn't have children anymore, I cried when The adoption baby was bought out and I sobbed and sobbed when the little girl died. I wasn't expecting such an emotion attack but I was fully involved in the narrative. If you like Cary Grant or Irene Dune watch this, If you like very well acted dramas watch this, If you like films watch this, I seriously doubt you will be disappointed! 10/10"
"25638_0.txt",473,"Patrick Still Lives is a curious piece of cult cinema; not for its content, but merely for the fact that it was made. Patrick was an obscure (and rather boring) Australian thriller released in 1978 and I doubt even the makers of it would have planned a sequel; but for some reason Giallo a Venezia director Mario Landi saw fit to direct a (presumably) unofficial sequel to it anyway. I have no idea what the actual reasons are for this film being made; but given Italy's film-making record, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that this film started life as merely a thriller about a comatose patient with telekinetic powers and ended as a 'sequel' to Patrick simply to cash in on the title. Anyway, the plot here is just as thin as it was in the original film and focuses on a comatose patient named Patrick. He may be in a coma but this doesn't stop him killing as he has telekinetic powers, and the guests staying at his father's spa soon find themselves becoming victim to Patrick's murderous rage.<br /><br />All in all, it really has to be said that Patrick Still Lives isn't very good. However, it is fun in places; and Mario Landi has proved once and for all that films about murderous comatose patients are much better when they feature a bunch of gory death scenes. Most of the death scenes in this film are ridiculous, but at least the director doesn't hold back and we get treated to a range of grisly ways for the main characters to die. As anyone who has seen Giallo a Venezia will expect, much of it is of the misogynistic variety; with one death scene in particular, which sees one of the ladies have a poker rammed up her vagina (in a really rather bizarre scene that has to be seen to be believed!) being a major standout. Nudity is strongly featured also, most of it from the female cast members. Outside of the nudity and gore, there's not a great deal to like here to be honest. The film is not badly put together and the director shows some interesting use of colour, but the plot is pretty much nonexistent and much of the film is just padding for the death scenes. But hey, I love this stuff and despite its numerous problems, I'm going to give it a thumbs up anyway."

"21993_0.txt",475,"An artful mixture of deft, laugh-out-loud comedy, interspersed with touching poignant moments, makes this film special and unforgettable. Elaine May's direction was delicate yet purposeful, allowing for the superb development of characters ( in particular Eddie Albert's curmudgeonly businessman/father) without impeding the flow of the plot.<br /><br />In this social portrayal of the Peter Principle, the glib, shallow Lenny somehow talks himself to dizzying social and economic heights all without the benefit of a pedigree or occupational skill set. Albert's father figure takes no time at all to see through all of this; but he is outnumbered by his wife and daughter who succumb to Lenny's charms. You can't help but feel this man's helpless pain in having to watch his lovely, impressionable daughter lured into a clearly doomed marriage.<br /><br />Cybil Shephard, Eddie Albert and Charles Grondin all turned in career performances. This show was one of those rare times when everything (directing, writing and acting) came together to create something greater than the sum of its parts - it's a real treasure."

The smalltime gangsters rules the city and the locals try their best to maintain some degree of peace in their small society. When Richard decides to let the toughs know that his back, he immediately causes fear and awakens hidden memories from the darkest sides of their past. Richard is not back to reunite with old friends! Behind his cold and robust appearance lies a merciless hate. A hate about to overcome his soul. Anthonys absentmindedness makes him incapable of understanding Richards plans. Richard was always the one to watch over Anthony and protect him from trouble, but he seems to have lost his sense of responsibility to his younger brother. Someone has crossed Richards line of tolerance. They have committed a heartless act without considering the consequences. Remorse is to late. There is no remedy for their action. Richards heart is bowling over in hate and his soul has no room for forgiveness.<br /><br />Paddy Considine known from ""In America""(2002), ""My Summer Of Love""(2004) and ""Cinderella Man""(2005), plays the revengeful ex-marine Richard with authority and credibility in on of the best performances of his career. Toby Kebell delivers a remarkable portrayal as the gullible Anthony. The detailed cinematography by Danny Choen balances between adventures beauty and cryptic darkness. Shane Medows use of flashback scenes in black and white gives the film a grieving and disturbing mood. A strong and invading thriller that's uneasy to forget!"
"39498_0.txt",477,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this film. I suppose I did want to see some schoolgirls and some chains. And I sort of got both. There are maybe 2 scenes with chains, but they are like dog leashes, which is pretty silly. And after forcing myself to finish the abortive The Forest, by the same director,(and yes, I foolishly purchased The Forest, curse my hide), I have no idea why I wanted to see this. I read that this was up on the banned list for a while, not sure if it really was banned or what. Apparently the title Schoolgirls in Chains was substituted with Abducted, but some censors still found copies with the original title and flipped. Anyway... What you have here is your basic Psycho rip-off with a little Of Mice and Men thrown in. Two brothers, one a sort of regular guy(who sleeps with his mother, OK there is no sleeping going on) and another guy who is a simpleton who likes to play children's games, live in a house where they keep girls they have abducted under their home in a cellar. There aren't a lot of sex games, as one might expect with a title like this, but there is one rape scene which is rather mild and brief. Mainly, you have the idiot brother, John, playing games like Hide n Seek or Follow the Leader with the girls as the damsels plot for ways to escape. Of course, I was waiting the whole time for the ""pay-off"" which would come in the form of some good revenge on the part of the girls. Unfortunately, that didn't really happen. Frank, the ""regular fellow,"" does get his comeuppance, but by his own hand, leaving John presumably to be a ward of the state again. Strictly speaking for myself, because I'm strange, I would have thought a much better ending would involve the latter-day heroine, Bonnie, and her boyfriend going into the upstairs bedroom and finding Frank and John in bed with their mother's dead body, or Frank dressed as his mother with John next to him and Frank talking like their mother. Or just shotgun the lot of them. <br /><br />In short, you really have to have nothing better to watch than to sit through this one. Minimal nudity, no gore(except for a shot or two of a decaying body), sloooow pacing, bad acting, no violence to speak of, etc. But....it's still a lot better than The Forest."

I always found ""Macbeth"" to be one of Shakespeare's funniest plays and I'm glad that this filmmaker does as well. After adjusting to the American accents (which add to the humour, because the ""Scottish Play"" is never actually performed with the appropriate burr anyway), I settled in for an enjoyable 90 minutes of sight gags, over-the-top characters, and word-play that was reminiscent of some of our better television programmes. One wonders if the writer is a fan of Ben Elton or Tom Stoppard (or both?). What Monty Python did for Jesus in ""Life of Brian"" this film does for Macbeth. Is nothing sacred? Thankfully not."
"49276_0.txt",481,"The first time I saw the trailer for this film was about year ago inside a movie house. It showed a lot of promise, I was even mesmerized as it used Josh Groban's Mi Mancherai to great effect which left the viewer with such a teaser that I could not wait to know more about the film and its plot. Soon after wards a lot of internet hype went into this film based upon the fact that a lot of people are anticipating M. Night Shyamalan's movies. With the lackluster ""The Village"" as this film's predecessor it was time to look into a refreshing albeit familiar direction one expects of M. Night and after a year or so of waiting I finally saw it tonight. It is by far, the most unimaginative of all of M. Night Shyamalan's films and to me the most self-indulgent. Most of the time the film seems to be trying too hard to put that mystery and suspense that it feels contrived. I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of ""Hollywood special effects"" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films. This feels like a sell out film and I think a wee bit egotistical to put himself as an important though not central character instead of his usual cameo appearance. This I think was the most detrimental to an already obtuse storyline. In closing, I think he should go back to the style that he became famous for and not try too hard to get lost in his own myth and persona."
"41916_0.txt",482,"Why can't I put in a 0 vote? This movie sucks worse than any imaginable black hole.

Hail Eris, I say!<br /><br />And all the time wasted on chasing a guy on a bike, then drop him from a helicopter.

"49173_0.txt",484,"This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment, but here are a few nonetheless.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of ""My Mother the Car"").<br /><br />At any rate, the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.<br /><br />Considering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.<br /><br />The best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.<br /><br />Ironically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of ""Mother,"" IS included in the film. Go figure.<br /><br />Connery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.<br /><br />Quirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.<br /><br />On a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.<br /><br />At any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for ""Return to Gilligan's Island."" Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of ""The Avengers"" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint."
"6211_0.txt",485,"""Calendar Girls"" is an amusing comedy of the sort that the British have done very well during the past 50 years. Helen Mirren (Chris) and Julie Waters (Annie) are excellent as the two best friends who execute Chris' idea of a nude calendar to raise funds for the leukemia wing of the hospital where Annie's husband died. Like many British films centered on areas outside London, it brings in accents that are difficult for these American ears. I've often wished that the British would add subtitles at some points so that I'd know what's being said. That may sound ridiculous but the PBS News Hour and occasionally CNN do it regularly when Iraqis or Pakistanis or Afghans, for example, are being interviewed in English that is hard for viewers to understand. Although the story is easy to follow, there were some scenes where my wife and I lost lines of dialog because of impenetrable accents. Even though I've spent a fair amount of time in England, I confess that I'm often baffled by North Country and Midlands accents. Perhaps in exchange we could provide British audiences with subtitles for regional accents in the U.S."

"28209_0.txt",487,"Pilloried in the decade that was His Time, Richard Lester had radishes thrown at him for being ""modish,"" gimmicky, aggressively hip. (The great Manny Farber was uncharacteristically cruel, cruel.) He may seem in some lights like the Austin Powers of auteurs, but time has been kind both to his formal gifts (as magnificent as Nicolas Roeg's--or David Fincher's) and to the complicated, unsentimental, but hard-beating heart at the center of his movies. At least one Lester work, 1968's PETULIA, ranks among the greatest movies ever made. This little-seen classic, a sort of British-seaside ENDGAME, gets my vote as the most thrillingly beautiful end-of-the-world movie ever.<br /><br />Coauthored by the ""Goon Show"" genius Spike Milligan, this post-apocalypse omnibus of sketches suggests John Osborne's Archie Rice rewriting an absurdist play by Gombrowicz. Tweedy lord Ralph Richardson post-atomically mutates into a bed sitting room while sixtyish, uncombed Michael Hordern uses the state of general unrest to get into bed with Rita Tushingham. (Her pregnancy arouses Hordern--until she gives birth, after seventeen months, to what is either a bird or a large pile of felt.) And above it all, Peter Cook flies on a hot-air balloon as a sexy cockney sadist--the post-nuclear Prime Minister to be, the first-draft choice of the Clockwork Orange Party.<br /><br />A plot summary does no justice to Lester's and the DP David Watkin's images, which challenge the Vesuvian frescos of FELLINI SATYRICON for sheer overwhelmage. And the work of Lester's longtime composer Kenneth Thorne, with its English merriment never once acknowledging its own irony, ranks with the tip-top achievements of Rota or Morricone. This is a beautiful, haunting, great, sadly completely forgotten movie. Film hipsters have had their day lapping up Lucio Fulci and Jess Franco. Bring back a guy who once had a real job! Up with Lester!<br /><br />"

"45658_0.txt",489,"To be quite frank with you, I'm not really into horror movies at all. Though I wasn't held at gunpoint to see this movie, but I was persuaded by my friends instead. Let's get straight to the point by saying, that ""The House on Haunted Hill"" isn't remotely scary at all. In fact it is less scary than entering a haunted mansion at an amusement park. In fact if anyone wishes for me to see this movie again, you better pay me $1 million, because I just won't do it.<br /><br />Now that I got that out of the way, let me break it down by examining the plot. Five guests have to spend one night in a burned down, condemned mental hospital in order to earn a quick million. If anything should happen to the guests, the money would be split among the survivors. The sole aspect that freaked me out was that it was set in a condemned sanitarium.And even that was not entirely convincing. I wasn't expecting Oscar-winning performances here, but the acting was purely banal, with the exception of Geoffrey Rush, who always cashes in terrific performances. Even though Chris Kattan was right up there with the other moving mannequins, he at least had some humorous lines. Scary doesn't describe my feelings about the movie, uncomfortable is the right word. <br /><br />Many elements of the movie that I found distracting is that since the house brings all the mental patients together under one leader, why are they not inflicting pain on each other as well? Also why does the ghostly monster has to break down doors and floors in order to get to the heroes and yet the mortals get thrown through walls. It also bugs me that they must walk into a person's office when they're lost, especially since they know where it is and in spite of a few of them being killed along the way. And finally, with only a little time left to collect their cash winning prizes, the guests decide to make up their own quest by attempting to escape the house instead. <br /><br />With these nuances I am convinced that those who have not seen it, are actually doing themselves a favor. I wanted at least the phantom-like monster to be scary as well, but that didn't happen either. In the end I was utterly exhausted and very frustrated by the whole, movie. Those who've seen it, tell those who never saw ""House on Haunted Hill"" to avoid it all costs. It wasn't scary or satisfying."

But other than that it was very enjoyable and fun. There was plenty of suspense and frightening moments. Humor was also added into the mix which is very nice except the comic relief, Shia's best friend Ronny is a bit annoying at times. <br /><br />The acting was good and the song choices were nice too- loved ""LONLY DAY"" by System of a down.

The story follows Brigitte, the more weird and less sexy of the two sisters from the first film who is now changing into a werewolf herself. For some reason that is never properly explained, she has infected herself with the curse via Ginger's blood and has gotten herself addicted to the cure, the plant; monkshood, in order to stop herself changing into a werewolf like her sister did. However, all is not so simple, as another werewolf is on the rampage and is stalking Brigitte because it wants to...ahem, mate with her. After surviving an attack from it, Brigitte is picked up by the police and taken to a rehabilitation clinic where she meets a whole host of new characters, including, most notably, a young weirdo called Ghost.<br /><br />Making a welcome return from the first film is the parallels that are drawn between turning into a werewolf and being a teenager. It's not put forward as forcefully as it was in the original and it seems to concentrate more on the drug taking tearaway side of being a teenager as opposed to the more normal side. There is significantly less humour in this outing, as the parents that delivered most of it last time round have been dropped, but one thing I did find rather amusing was the way that the film used the wolf that wants to mate with Brigitte: probably a commentary on hormonal young men. Unfortunately, Katherine Isabelle who played Ginger in the original film isn't in this film as much as most viewers would like, and she serves the plot in more of an advisory capacity (much like the ghost in American Werewolf in London) and this doesn't allow her much screen time (although this will hopefully be rectified in the prequel; Ginger Snaps Back). One thing that this film definitely has over the original is the werewolf effects; they were terrible in the first film and really let it down, but here they seem to have taken influence from Dog Soldiers and look much better for it.<br /><br />The new cast of characters don't make up for the relative loss of Ginger, but nevertheless; they're largely well done. Ginger's ""replacement"" is the aforementioned young girl, known as 'Ghost'. Ghost is an interesting character, and despite being a child; doesn't manage to become annoying, which is rare. The other two main characters are a male nurse, and a drugs councillor, both of which serve as metaphors for different roles in teenage life. What sets this film apart from many modern day horror films of this nature is that it's story driven, and rather restrained in the gore department. The film also has an atmosphere of tragedy throughout. This is one of the things I liked best about the original; the dark and morbidity of what's happening on screen consolidates with the characters, and are almost an extension of those characters; which also serves in giving the film a degree of intelligence.<br /><br />The tragedy of the first film was brought to a head by way of it's brilliant and heartbreaking ending, and this film would have to work hard if it was even going to attempt at topping it. It didn't top it - the ending here, although good, and very imaginative isn't as well done as the idea suggests it could have been; and that's a shame. Other than that, however; this is one of the best horror sequels in a long time, and comes with the highest recommendation."
"10817_0.txt",493,"Movie opens with Scott Cowley (Andrew Bowen of Mad TV) on a hunting trip in Cameroon with his brother Charlie. A creature comes out of the jungle and rips Scott's leg off. Charlie can only watch him die.<br /><br />Present day, Scott's wife (Sarah Aldrich of Port Charles) is in a new, unhappy marriage with Scott's friend Mitchell (the under-appreciated Richard Tyson of Two Moon Junction and Hardball), who was also along on the hunting trip years before. Son Derek (Trevor Duke) doesn't get along with stepdad Mitch, and things only get worse when he steals the key to Mitch's secluded cabin and heads out with some frat buddies, their girlfriends, and his pal Samantha (Kim Brown of The Guiding Light). Just when things are heating up at the cabin, a werewolf bursts in and kills everyone but Derek and Sam, who narrowly escape. The two lie about what happened at the cabin to the local sheriff (David Naughton of American Werewolf in London), thinking that no one will believe that a werewolf was responsible for the killings.<br /><br />Derek and Sam have suspicions about Mitch, but don't know how to prove them. Enter Uncle Charlie, who has suspicions of his own ever since the Africa trip. He and the kids set out to prove that Mitch is the werewolf. A clever cat and mouse game ensues, that leads to a final confrontation back at the cabin.<br /><br />This was well written for a relatively low budget horror flick. There is some actual character development and some welcome bits of black humor. The directing and acting are uniformly good, also unusual for a teen oriented film, and the characters are all pretty likable and behave in an intelligent manner to deal with the problem, for the most part. Richard Tyson shines in an admittedly limited role as the sinister stepdad/beast. Trevor Duke as Derek fares less well as the wishy washy, ineffective hero for the bulk of the movie. The gore special effects are more than adequate, though the werewolf transformation sequences leave something to be desired.<br /><br />All in all, Big Bad Wolf moved along at a good pace, was interesting if nothing new or special, and had a good conclusion. Maybe not in the same league as the Universal Wolfman, or Brotherhood of the Wolf, it's still way better than most of the recent crop of werewolf flicks."
"25887_0.txt",494,"I am a fan of the Real World and thought the idea of a Lost Season movie sounded pretty cool. Knowing that it was all an acted out production unlike the Real World was ok with me. The idea seemed original and interesting with a season gone very wrong and the tapes and footage being covered up. My first disappointment came with the marketing strategy used in the promotion. They seemed to try to go with the Blair Witch approach by saying there was a lost season of film not used due to a disaster of some sort. That was sort of cool and gave it an almost scary and suspenseful feel. Then the later advertising became annoying by using goofy reporters and very unreal Real World executives. These terrible ads made me not want to tune in to this 2-hour commercial free presentation. Still I gave it a chance having been pleased by previous M TV productions in the past. To my disappointment the movie was just as bad as the commercials. The appearance of some of the original Real World casts was a plus, and then the actors came in to play and ruined it all. The story was poorly written with no imagination and only cashing in on the cheap thrills that M TV uses so often such as sex, sexuality, and sex. M TV also tried to rip off on The Blair Witch Project once more with its jerky camera work. The acting was terrible which is weird since the magic of the Real World is the fact there is no acting. This idea had so much promise but just fell in the wrong hands to carry it out. I recommend not watching the re-airing of this movie and knowing M TV there will be plenty of re-airings in the future. After seeing this movie I think maybe M TV should hang up the filming hat and go back to the basics, namely music and leave films to some one else. In the end this Real World movie was a Real Loser."
"18863_0.txt",495,"This is one of the worst new horror movies I've ever seen. Okay, there are a lot of bad new horror movies out there (the prequels to the prequels of famous 70's or 80's horror classics), but these is really far from the worse. I can't understand who is actually letting Rob Zombie (a rock singer or whatever he is) to direct this piece of crap, because he is even worse horror movie director than famous ""Ed Wood"". Even more, Plan 9 from Outer Space is a brilliant classic comparing to this amateur horror movie.<br /><br />The plot: two guys and two girls are searching for the clues for the local legend Dr. Satan. After that they found a house of the disturbing family, full of serial killers. The story is ""copy - paste"" of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nothing more than that. That proves that Rob Zombie is talentless idiot, who is stealing everything from the classic horror movies. There is nothing original in this movie so I am quite angry to see how some people can afford to direct movies with nothing to show in it, just a bunch of washed up ideas. But there is a lot of people out there, who are having a fresh ideas, but they can't show it to the world because they don't have the connections in Hollywood or entertainment industry.<br /><br />The main villain is named Dr. Satan. How long did Rob Zombie need to came up with so predictable and unoriginal name like Dr. Satan? The violence in the movie is silly and boring. You have a feeling like Zombie is filling us with violence because he doesn't have no idea how to develop a story. The acting is horrible and so bad even for the lowest ""B"" movies. Hell... even Sarah Michelle Gellars acted better in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER movies. The script is really bad written, like it was written by 5 - year old kid, who thinks that Sleeping Beauty is a horror story. The dialogs and humor is even worse, jokes are bad, primitive and without any sense. The music is okay, but for that I rather go to the concert than watching this piece of untalented crap movie.<br /><br />House of 1000 corpses is a good sample of the fact, that you can be whatever you want (despite of not having good ideas), as long you're having a good connections in the entertainment industry. Rob Zombie doesn't have nothing to say: he's just copying stuff from the other movies and deliver them to his fans. That's insulting.<br /><br />P.S.: There is no spoilers in my comment, because I was watching this movie for about 15. minutes."
"39391_0.txt",496,"This used to be a great TV series, until the 'reformers' got their PC focus group mits on it. Regular viewers will know what I'm talking about: when they changed the excellent original theme music (moody saxophone solo from the pen of Barrington Pheloung) and that accompanied a change in line-up. Out went the brilliantly under-played character of DS Edgar 'Wieldy' Wield (played by the excellent David Royle) and in came the 'I can't act for toffee and I've even got an annoyingly grating accent' Jennifer James in the role of WPC Kim Spicer and the inconsequential Wayne Perrey as DC Parvez Lateef. The show started out broodingly edgy and is now a faint shadow of its former self with the team now seeming more like the Scooby Gang than the hard-bitten original version. So come on BBC - less of the Kim Scrappy-Doo Spicer and let's get back to the original idea I used to love. The old show would get an 8 from me, but this incarnation struggles to get a 4."
"15832_0.txt",497,"""What a turkey!"" This is a simple line spoken by one of the characters as he's watching a random movie in the drive-in theater, but the phrase is actually much more applicable to the production he's starring in himself! This is a truly abysmal low-budget horror flick, put together by a bunch of amateurs that know nothing about cinema but simply wanted to cash-in on the success of such contemporary classics like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Two very UN-heroic police detectives investigate a series of murders that all took place in a Californian drive-in movie theater. It looks like some nutbag is practicing his sword-swashbuckling techniques on the horny customers there. The suspects include the theater's owner (who used to be a carny), the simple-minded janitor and the local pervert that spies upon young couples. Apart from some filthy gore (the best bits occurring in the opening minutes already), there's nothing to see here, unless if you're an admirer of bad acting, bad directing, bad editing, bad photography and even worse music. I couldn't understand half of the dialogs because all the moronic characters were mumbling, and the other half just didn't make any sense. The ""red herring"" climax is overlong and, despite its short running time, there are still way too many boring moments in the script. The concept and set pieces easily could have resulted in a much better (pre-slasher?) horror movie, if only some talent was involved. Incredibly bad film, avoid like the plague."
"38769_0.txt",498,"Struggled to stay awake during the picture...typical VanDisel, but he's done much better in the past.<br /><br />Had to many unanswered questions on why things happened the way they did in this picture. Also ended with a question whether or not there will be a continuation --- hopefully not.<br /><br />Wondered why the picture started with such a hard line and a tough guy but ended entirely opposite which spoiled the VanDisel image in my opinion.<br /><br />For futuristic, it didn't look much like it, scenery was second class and nothing spectacular about it.<br /><br />Hopefully the next VanDisel picture will be a lot better and more like his XXX pictures which is what he's known for."
"8985_0.txt",499,"This was a great film, superbly crafted. The two stories were not given equal time in the film, as they should not have. Although Selma Blair delivers, what I believe to be, her best performance to date, her ""story"" pales in comparison to the ""Nonfiction"" part of the movie, which gives a much more real and brutal account of Mark Webbers character, Scooby.<br /><br />I would rather not give a plot summary nor deliberate on inconsequential details of the movie, but suffice to say this is a must see! While it may not be as eloquent as American Beauty, Storytelling provides a wonderful snapshot into the psyche of high school and college life wrapped in some extraordinary circumstances. This film is a testament to despair, self loathing and personal struggle.<br /><br />The ending is, perhaps, the crown jewel of this film. It made my jaw drop and, in fact, I sat in front of the TV for a number of minutes before I regained my senses. Side note: I had to watch ""Fiction"" twice, as I failed to see its correlation to ""Nonfiction"" when I watched it the first time.<br /><br />My vote: 8 out of 10"
"45611_0.txt",500,"Saw this in the theater in 1981. Had a blast.<br /><br />Saw it when it first got released on video in 1984. Had a laugh.<br /><br />Saw it on cable last week. Had a fit.<br /><br />To be fair, it was almost original during its original run. But now that all the clichés have been run into the ground, it's not worth a second look.<br /><br />Linda Blair was the best actress here. And while Vinny Van Patten has done some good performances, this wasn't one of them. He didn't seem comfortable playing a surfer 'dude.' <br /><br />For Linda Blair fans/completests only."
